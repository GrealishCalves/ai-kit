# Guideline to Thought Processes — Kickoff Playbook

Use this checklist *before* you prompt an AI agent (or teammate) for a new feature plan. It distills the early-phase lessons from the three prior transcripts so you can scope the request correctly and surface missing context up front.

---

## 1. Clarify the desired outcome
- What tangible deliverable do you expect right now (plan, evaluation, implementation, or verification)?
- What should be explicitly out of scope for this request?
- What timeframe, risk tolerance, or approval limits apply?

## 2. Collect essential context
- Summarize the current state: existing blockers, previous attempts, relevant files, known constraints.
- Note any dependencies (services, repos, stakeholders) the agent must respect.
- Link to authoritative references (docs, specs, prior transcripts) that must guide the work.

## 3. Form critical questions
- What open questions *must* be answered before building anything?
- Which assumptions need validation (environments, permissions, data sources)?
- What signals will confirm success versus failure?

## 4. Communicate expectations clearly
- Restate the problem, scope, constraints, and success criteria in plain language.
- Call out non-negotiables (avoid new tooling, don’t touch certain files, etc.).
- Ask the agent to reflect uncertainties back to you before producing the plan.

## 5. Watch for red flags
- Feeling pressure to promise a solution path before verifying scope alignment.
- Skipping stakeholder or dependency checks.
- Treating “figure it out later” as acceptable for core requirements.

Keep this playbook handy for every new request. It primes the conversation so the first response you receive is aligned, scoped, and grounded in real constraints.
