# Preferences

Adjust your preferences to help you move faster and personalize your workflow.

## [General⁠

](#general)

The general preferences offer high-level adjustments for how you want things to appear in Linear.

### [Default home view⁠

](#default-home-view)

This setting lets you set the default view that opens whenever you close or log out of Linear and re-open/re-login. It defaults to your team's `Active issues` view, which is the view that shows all issues that are in an _Unstarted_ or _Started_ workflow status.

To change your default home view, open the dropdown menu to select from any of these default views:

- All issues
- Active issues
- Current cycle
- Inbox
- My Issues
- Favorited Views
- Favorited Projects

### [Display full names⁠

](#display-full-names)

Select whether you want to see your team members' full names or the username they have personalized in their Profile section.

### [First day of the week⁠

](#first-day-of-the-week)

Personalize how you want your calendars to display your weeks.

### [Convert text emoticons into emojis⁠

](#convert-text-emoticons-into-emojis)

Turn this toggle on to speed up emoji input.

## [Interface and theme⁠

](#interface-and-theme)

Adjust your font size and/or opt for a pointer cursor when hovering over interactive elements.

Choose from our presets or create your own custom theme for your workspace. Select several Light or Dark modes as a preference or choose system preference if you'd like the app to switch based on your computer settings.

You can also build your own custom theme. Find and use over 70 themes (and counting!) on the open source site [linear.style](https://linear.style/), where you can click to copy and use them.

## [Desktop application⁠

](#desktop-application)

When logged into your web app and navigating to your preferences, you have the option to selecting whether you want Linear links to be directed to your desktop app.

Select whether you want notification badges on your desktop app icon, or remove them to avoid the noise.

Spell check is available here as well to aid you in typing.

## [Automations and workflows⁠

](#automations-and-workflows)

### [Auto-assign to self⁠

](#auto-assign-to-self)

Optionally, enable an automation to always assign issues you create to yourself. You can also configure whether you should be auto-assigned to issues you move to a started status.

If you don't turn these on, you can always toggle the Create more button or use Cmd/Ctrl Shift Enter when creating issues to create more with the same assignee. We don't have a setting to auto-assign issues to specific users. The best way to accomplish that workflow is to create templates with the assignee field set to a specific user.

### [Git attachment format⁠

](#git-attachment-format)

Display title, or title and repository for your git attachments.

### [Git-related automations⁠

](#git-related-automations)

If you've enabled Linear's GitHub or GitLab integrations, you'll likely copy the git branch name with Cmd/Ctrl Shift . to link Linear issues to pull requests. You can set two actions to happen whenever you do:

- **\*On git branch copy, move issue to started status** \*which moves the issue to the first workflow status under the started category (often "In progress").
- **On git branch copy, auto-assign to yourself**

We highly recommend these settings for any developers using Linear. In combination, they save you a few clicks every time you begin an issue.

# Assign and delegate issues

---

## [Overview⁠

](#overview)

Issues in Linear are assigned to a single person at a time, giving teams clear ownership and responsibility. Assignment helps teammates triage, track, and prioritize work.

Delegation is a form of assignment used with [agents](https://linear.app/docs/agents-in-linear), allowing them to take action on an issue while the assigned teammate maintains ownership.

### [Assigning issues⁠

](#assigning-issues)

You can assign issues at any point—while creating them, triaging new work, or reviewing and editing existing issues.

To assign an issue, open the issue and use the assignee field in the properties sidebar to choose a teammate or agent. You can also assign directly from cards in board views and issue list views by clicking the assignee avatar, or press `A` when viewing or hovering over an issue to open the assignment menu.

Seek to:00:00 / Duration00:00

Remaining−00:00
0.25×0.5×0.75×1×1.25×1.5×1.75×2×

To assign yourself quickly, press `I` while viewing an issue or when hovering in list view.

You can also open the command menu (`⌘K`) and search for "Assign to..." to make updates via keyboard. For bulk assignment, use multi-select in list or board views by typing `X` when hovering over the issue, and right-click to update the assignee from the bulk action bar.

To remove an assignee, choose "No assignee" from the assignment menu.

#### [**Assignment permissions**⁠

](#assignment-permissions)

- Issues in public teams can be assigned to any workspace member
- Private team issues can only be assigned to members of the private team
- Issues cannot be assigned to guests and inactive users

### [Delegating to agents⁠

](#delegating-to-agents)

To delegate work, you can assign an issue to an agent. When you delegate an issue to an agent, you remain the primary assignee and the agent is added as an additional contributor working on your behalf.

Seek to:00:00 / Duration00:00

Remaining−00:00
0.25×0.5×0.75×1×1.25×1.5×1.75×2×

You can change the agent at any time or remove them by selecting "No agent" from the assignment menu.

To delegate an issue to an agent, make sure the agent has access to the team the issue belongs to. Team membership is set when the agent integration is added to a workspace and can be changed by an admin at any time.

### [Managing assigned issues⁠

](#managing-assigned-issues)

#### [User views⁠

](#user-views)

Assigned issues, even those delegated to an agent, appear in your [My Issues](https://linear.app/docs/my-issues) default view, where you can review all issues you're responsible for across your workspace. This view updates automatically based on assignment changes to track the progress of your assigned and delegated work.

Assigned and delegated issues also appear in any [custom views](https://linear.app/docs/custom-views) filtered by _Assignee_ or _Agent_.

---

#### [History⁠

](#history)

When viewing issues, the assignment and delegation history is tracked in its Activity feed, which shows changes over time and who made them.

#### [Inbox⁠

](#inbox)

You are automatically subscribed to issues that are assigned to you. You will be notified of any updates to your assigned issues in your [Inbox](https://linear.app/docs/inbox). You can filter Inbox activity by assignment using the "Notification type" filter to focus on issues that have been assigned to you.

#### [Search⁠

](#search)

You can filter your searches by assignee or by the agent they've been delegated to through [Search](https://linear.app/docs/search) to locate relevant issues based on ownership or automation.

#### [Insights⁠

](#insights)

[Insights](https://linear.app/docs/insights) surface trends in how work is distributed across assigned teammates and agents. You can report on issues by assignee or by the agent they’ve been delegated to, helping teams understand ownership patterns and automation coverage.

Available to workspaces on our [Business](https://linear.app/pricing) and [Enterprise](https://linear.app/pricing) plans.

### [Automation⁠

](#automation)

Linear supports automated issue assignment that helps teams route and manage issues with minimal input.

Optionally enable an automation to automatically assign yourself to issues you create. To set up this automation, refer to [Preferences](https://linear.app/docs/account-preferences). If you choose not to enable this setting, you can still use the Create more button in an issue draft or press `⌘` + `Shift` + `Enter` when submitting an issue to quickly create another with the same assignee.

Linear doesn’t currently support auto-assigning issues to a specific teammate by default, but you can use templates to pre-fill the assignee field.

When a teammate creates a Git branch from an issue, it can automatically assign the issue to them and move it to a started status when you copy the git branch name. This is configurable in [Preferences](https://linear.app/docs/account-preferences).

For custom rules to assign issues when they enter Triage, you can configure [triage routing](https://linear.app/docs/triage#triage-routing). Based on issue properties like team, status, or label, these rules route issues to a specific team and set an assignee. Rules can also delegate issues to an agent as part of the same flow for even greater automation during triage.

Triage routing is available on our Enterprise plan.

# Board layout

Nearly all views in Linear can be shown in board layout in addition to list view.

## [Configure⁠

](#configure)

You can toggle on board layout with the keyboard shortcut Cmd/Ctrl B. Alternatively, you can switch between board or list layout using the board and list icons next to `Display options`.

KeyboardMouseCommand menu

Cmd/Ctrl B to switch to board layout (or back to list)

X to select one issue

Shift X or or Shift `Click` to select multiple issues

Option/Alt Shift Up or Down to move a selected issue to the top or bottom of the column

T to toggle the collapse or expansion of a swimlane

Click on _Board_ icon to the left of _View Options_ and select board layout on most views

Create issue by clicking the _+_ sign at the top of a column to create an issue in that column.

Hide a column by clicking the more menu (three dots). Unhide a column by scrolling to the right-most column. Filter to show only specific columns or toggle off the View _Option Show empty groups_ to hide empty columns.

`board` to select show in `show in board view`

## [Basics⁠

](#basics)

### [Feature parity⁠

](#feature-parity)

Functionality and keyboard shortcuts are almost exactly the same on board and list views with a few exceptions.

- Board views and List view cannot be ordered independently. If a List view is ordered by priority for example, Board view will be ordered the same way.
- Board views to default to grouping by Status but you can click into `Display options` and `Grouping` to group by Focus, Status, Project, Priority, Cycle, Label, Label group, or SLA status (if applicable).
- When grouping by status, board views are always ordered with statuses from first to last, whereas some list views have unique ordering for statuses.
- You can hide columns in board views but in list views, you can only temporarily hide the equivalent column/grouping option by using filters. You can then make a custom view if you'd like these filters to be permanent.

The same shortcuts work to select issues in the board view, such as X to select specific issues and Shift X or Shift Click to select multiple.

### [Hide columns⁠

](#hide-columns)

Hide columns you don't need by selecting _Hide_ from the column menu (three dots). Hidden columns will show up as the last column on your board. Drag issues into hidden columns without having to unhide them.

### [Move to top or bottom⁠

](#move-to-top-or-bottom)

To avoid dragging issues up or down long columns, use keyboard shortcuts instead. Option/Alt Shift Up will move issues to the top of a column whereas Option/Alt Shift Down will move it to the bottom. By default, when you move issues to a new column on a board, it will go to the top if you make the change with the keyboard shortcut S or command menu and to wherever you placed it if you used the mouse.

### [Navigating columns⁠

](#navigating-columns)

Board views with multiple columns can be scrolled horizontally by holding Shift and scrolling vertically, or using horizontal scroll if your device supports it (like on a trackpad or Magic Mouse).

Alternatively, click and pull an empty space in the board to scroll horizontally.

### [Swimlanes⁠

](#swimlanes)

Board and list views have the option to display an extra dimension for visualising your projects or issues in lanes or rows on a board view, commonly known as swimlanes in project management.

These sub-grouping options are especially useful for a high-level overview of the company's progress or resource allocation. You can sort by columns, group those columns and lay them out as rows for your chosen dimension such as teams, cycles, assignee, lead, initiative or project health to name a few.

These lanes can be collapsed or expanded for further visual clarity in board view.

Swimlanes showing projects grouped by status and target dates.

## [FAQ⁠

](#faq)

Can you set board to be the default layout for the workspace?[
](#collapsible-176f91fdf6d7)

Unfortunately, you can't set board view as a universal default. However, a user can choose board layout in a view and then select `view options` and `set as default` to ensure board layout is the default for that view for anyone who visits that one view.
This won't prevent other members from changing this and setting a new default afterwards though.

Why is Board layout not showing as an option?[
](#collapsible-5873931a4fdf)

It is not possible to select board layout in split views like Inbox or Triage.

Can I show descriptions or all issue properties in board layout?[
](#collapsible-0ca63e2dc0c9)

Descriptions are not shown on cards. If an issue has many properties, not all properties may have space to be display on the card.

Use Space while hovering your cursor over a card to peek for more detail, or open the issue to see all properties.

# Comments and reactions

Leave comments or reactions on issues.

## [Overview⁠

](#overview)

Comments and reactions allow for team collaboration within an issue.

All users with access to an issue can post comments and threaded replies. React with emoji on the issue description itself, or on individual comments or threads.

## [Post a comment⁠

](#post-a-comment)

Comment on an issue by clicking into the "Leave a comment…" text box at the bottom of an issue. While issue description text is saved automatically, you will need to click the *Comment *button or ⌘/Ctrl Enter to post the comment to the issue. Unsent comments are visible on the issue, and in *Drafts *in your sidebar.

Attach files to a comment using the paperclip icon, ⌘/Ctrl Shift A, or drag and drop.

## [Edit or manage a comment⁠

](#edit-or-manage-a-comment)

To edit an existing comment you wrote on an issue, click on the ... icon to the top right of the comment and select edit. Click save to save any changes you make.

Other options in this menu allow you to manage your subscription to that thread, copy a URL to the comment, create a new issue or sub-issue from the comment, or delete the comment.

## [Threads⁠

](#threads)

Threads allow you to continue on a topic mentioned in a comment. To create a threaded comment:

- Hover over the comment you'd like to respond to
- Click on the _arrow_ icon for **Reply to comment** in the top right.

If a thread already exists, click into the text box at the bottom of this comment thread and start crafting your response. Send threads as you would a regular comment.

### [Resolve threads⁠

](#resolve-threads)

Resolving threads clarifies when a question has been answered or a decision is made. This is particularly useful in longer threads to clearly identify the resolution.

Mark a thread as resolved through the overflow menu on the root message. To showcase a specific resolution, resolve a thread from a particular reply to expose that reply specifically.

With the setting [_Enable resolved thread AI summaries_](https://linear.app/docs/comment-on-issues#summaries-on-resolved-threads) enabled, AI will generate summaries for resolved comment threads.

Remaining−00:00
0.25×0.5×0.75×1×1.25×1.5×1.75×2×

## [Summaries⁠

](#summaries)

Get up to speed on long discussions with AI-generated summaries.

Available to workspaces on our [Business](https://linear.app/pricing) and [Enterprise](https://linear.app/pricing) plans.

### [Issue discussion summaries⁠

](#issue-discussion-summaries)

Discussion summaries provide a condensed record of decisions, blockers, debates and their resolutions, and the people involved in those discussions. They update automatically as comments are added or removed, ensuring the content reflects the current state of the conversation.

These summaries are generated automatically when an issue contains at least 19 comments or 100 words of discussion. Each bullet point includes a citation linking back to its source comment, so you can see the exact quote and context.

As discussions evolve, summaries regenerate incrementally. The summary appears above the issue’s comments, giving a structured view without needing to read through the entire thread.

### [Resolved comment thread summaries⁠

](#resolved-comment-thread-summaries)

When a thread is resolved without a closing comment, Linear will generate a short summary of the discussion that appears on the resolved thread.

Elapsed00:00

Seek to:00:00 / Duration00:00

Remaining−00:00
0.25×0.5×0.75×1×1.25×1.5×1.75×2×

These summaries are visible only when the thread is collapsed, providing just enough context to understand what happened without reading the full thread. Enable this feature in a team's settings under _General_.

If the content of the thread changes, the summary will be updated automatically. If you resolve the thread with a reply comment, no summary is created. In this case, the resolving comment is treated as the final word in the conversation.

## [Emoji react to issues and comments⁠

](#emoji-react-to-issues-and-comments)

You can leave an emoji reaction on an issue or a comment by clicking the "Add reaction" icon visible at the bottom of any issue or when hovering a comment.

All official Unicode emojis are available by default. Custom emojis can be uploaded individually (JPG, GIF, and PNG formats are supported) or imported in bulk from your Slack workspace via the [Emoji settings](https://linear.app/settings/emojis) page.

# Concepts

Gain a basic understanding of Linear's design so you can set up your workspace and navigate efficiently.

## [Basic concepts⁠

](#basic-concepts)

### [Workspace⁠

](#workspace)

A Linear workspace is the container for all issues, teams and other concepts relating to an individual company (Vast.craft in the image above). As a user, you can have accounts on one or many workspaces and can switch between these accounts using the dropdown menu in the top left-hand corner of the application. Workspaces each have a unique URL in the style linear.app/example. When you log into Linear, you're logging into a specific workspace.

### [Teams⁠

](#teams)

A workspace has one or many teams within it. Teams typically represent groups of people who work together frequently, though in some cases you may choose to structure teams as parts of a product. Teams contain issues, and can have team-specific projects (though projects can also be shared between teams.)

Teams have their own settings available to configure features like Cycles, Triage, and Workflows so you can tailor each team to best fit how work gets done. Each team also contains an archive, which keeps a record of issues that are not being actively kept in your backlog (archive rules can be defined in team settings.)

### [Issues⁠

](#issues)

The most basic concept in Linear is the issue. Most other concepts in Linear are either associated with issues, or function to group issues together.

An issue represents a task described in plain language. Each issue must belong to a single Linear team, has an identifier constructed of its team ID and number, like "ENG-123".

Issues are required to have a title and status – all other properties and relations are optional. This makes it quick to create issues and cuts down on unnecessary work (see [_Write Issues Not User Stories_](https://linear.app/method/write-issues-not-user-stories)).

We support basic issue properties such as priority, estimate, label, due date, and assignee. You can create relations between issues to mark issues as blocked or blocking or create sub-issues.

You can create issues from anywhere in the app. Try it - open any page in the app and type C.

#### [Workflows⁠

](#workflows)

As you work on and complete issues, they'll move through workflows; a group of ordered issue statuses defined per-team. These are the statuses that you'll see group issues on list views and show up as column headers on boards. We create a default workflow for you that you can further customize in Settings.

You can update issue statuses manually to reflect the current progress on that task. Where possible however, we recommend using integrations or automations to update issue status to avoid the need to "manage tickets".

For example, our GitHub and GitLab integrations move issues to _In Progress_ when you copy the git branch name and continues to update the status as the PR is drafted, opened, reviewed, and merged. Cycle automations move issues to and from the backlog and you can set issues to close and archive on their own so lists stay relevant.

**Special Statuses
**

- **Backlog** is a status category in Linear. Each team has its own backlog and teams can add additional backlog statuses to group issues down further.

- **Triage** is an optional status in Linear that makes it possible to review issues before accepting them and moving them to your team's backlog or cycles.

## [Organizing issues⁠

](#organizing-issues)

### [Projects⁠

](#projects)

Projects group issues towards a specific, time-bound deliverable, like launching a new feature. Projects have their own pages in Linear that display all issues related to a project, project details, and graphs that show progress and project completion date ranges. Projects can be shared across multiple teams and organized under Initiatives or Project views.

#### [Milestones⁠

](#milestones)

Milestones are a concept used to further organize issues inside an individual project. For each project, define milestones in a way that represent meaningful stages of completion for that project, and assign issues in the project to those milestones.

You can filter by milestones in a project, and easily see how close to completion an individual milestone is at a given time based on the issues belonging to that milestone.

### [Cycles⁠

](#cycles)

Cycles are similar to sprints and prioritize a set of issues during a specific time period. Cycles are automated and repeating; you'll set a start date and duration for cycles, which will then repeat every *N *weeks*. *They specifically do not end in a release. Issues not completed during a cycle roll over to the next cycle and we display basic statistics around estimated workload and percentage completion.

Cycles do not necessarily have a thematic grouping like Projects, and recur automatically according to a schedule, where Projects are intentionally curated.

### [Issue Views⁠

](#issue-views)

Views group issues according to a set of filters. Some issue views come standard like a team's _Backlog, All,_ or *Active *issues, and you can define views based on any filter available in Linear. Because they're based on filters, views are dynamic -- when an issue meets the filter set defining the view they'll appear, when they no longer meet those criteria the issue will leave the view. Views can be constructed to be visible to only you, a particular team or your whole workspace.

- Access views to see all issues under a label, assigned to a user, or part of a particular cycle or project.
- My Issues is a curated set of views that shows you your assigned issues with the most relevant ones first, issues you've created, and ones you're subscribed to.

To build custom views, use filters on an existing view and then create a custom view from those parameters. You can also go to Views in the sidebar and create a custom view from scratch.

## [Organizing Projects⁠

](#organizing-projects)

### [Project Views⁠

](#project-views)

Project views are accessible from the sidebar under a team. Projects will appear in those categories based on the status of the project. You can also view projects at the workspace level to get an overview of all projects within your organization.

As with issue views, Project Views are dynamic: when a project meets the filter criteria of the view it will appear there, when it no longer meets the criteria it will leave the view. Project views represent the actual state of projects in your workspace.

### [Initiatives⁠

](#initiatives)

Initiatives organize your projects and showcase the goals your company is working towards alongside their progress. Each Initiative contains a manually curated list of projects and Initiatives are presented within a single Initiatives view at the workspace level. This enables high-level planning across multiple projects and long timelines.

Leadership and managers can use the top-level Initiatives view in their Linear workspace for a quick overview of ongoing goals, objectives, and their progress.

## [**Taking actions**⁠

](#taking-actions)

Whenever you do something in Linear that changes an issue, project, or another piece of data, you're taking an action.

### [How it works⁠

](#how-it-works)

We've designed Linear so that you can take actions in multiple ways: using buttons, keyboard shortcuts, contextual menus, or by searching for the action in the command line. This makes it easy to figure out how to do anything in the app and build muscle memory since you're always following the same patterns.

For example, let's say you want to apply the label _bug_ to an issue. You can follow any of these steps to do it:

- Open the issue and click the apply label button
- Right-click on the issue from the board or list view and use the contextual menu
- Use the keyboard shortcut L
- Open the command menu Cmd/Ctrl K then search `label`.

To do anything else to an issue - add an estimate, set priority, update status, set the assignee, add it to a project - you follow pretty much the same steps. To do anything to a project from the initiative or project view, you also take similar steps.

### [Bulk actions⁠

](#bulk-actions)

It's easy to update multiple issues at a time in Linear. You can move issues across teams, to and from cycles and projects, apply labels, and change status to tens or hundreds of issues at once. Cmd/Ctrl A will select all issues on a view and then you can take the action using any of the aforementioned methods.

An `Undo` action (Cmd/Ctrl Z) reverses most actions.

### [Keyboard shortcuts⁠

](#keyboard-shortcuts)

Your keyboard is the fastest method for using Linear. Even if you don't use keyboard shortcuts normally, we recommend learning ones for common actions such as creating an issue. These are the most helpful to learn:

C to create an issue in any view
Cmd/Ctrl K to open the command menu
x to select
Shift Up/Down or Shift Click to select multiple
Esc to go back or clear a list selection

Shortcuts cannot be remapped in Linear at this time, though we may consider adding custom shortcuts in the future.

### [Quick Navigation⁠

](#quick-navigation)

Shortcuts follow patterns so that you learn them quickly. Navigate between views with Gthen \_shortcuts: G then I to go to the Inbox, G then V to the current cycle, and G then B to the backlog.

### [Easy access⁠

](#easy-access)

O then \_ shortcuts launch menus to then open items on a list. O then F opens favorites, O then P opens projects, and O then C opens cycles.

See the full list of shortcuts by pressing ?.

### [Command menu⁠

](#command-menu)

The command menu lets you search and take any actions applicable to your view or selection.

Launch the command menu with Cmd K on macOS or Ctrl K on Windows or Linux.

Command menu actions are contextually dependent. For example, if you are looking at cycles and open the command menu, the command menu will first display commands that are related to cycles.

### [Mouse⁠

](#mouse)

Of course, you can also navigate and take actions with your mouse. We have buttons, menus, and dropdowns throughout the app. Right-clicking on issues in lists or boards or projects on the timeline will bring up contextual menus.

# Issue status

Set statuses that your issues will move through on each team.

## [Overview⁠

](#overview)

Issues statuses define the type and order of states that issues can move through from start to completion. These workflows are team-specific and come with a default set and order: _Backlog > Todo > In Progress > Done > Canceled_.

## [Configure⁠

](#configure)

Add or edit statuses in a team from **Settings -> Teams -> Issue statuses & automations\***. Y\*ou will see a list of all statuses in that team and their order. Click the three dots next to each status and select **Edit** to make changes to the name, color, or description. Create statuses by clicking the **+** button, or remove statuses (as long as at least one status exists in each category).

Statuses can be rearranged within a category but categories cannot be moved around. To change the order of a status, drag it to a new position.

**How we work at Linear**
We have the following workflow set up for our product team: ** \***Backlog*: Icebox, Backlog
*Unstarted*: Todo
*Started*: In Progress, In Review, Ready to Merge
*Completed*: Done
*Canceled\*: Canceled, Could not reproduce, Won't Fix, Duplicate

### [Default status⁠

](#default-status)

The default status defines the workflow status that will be applied to newly created issues in your team. This can be overridden by the user when creating an issue, but makes it a lot easier to track and organize new issues that come in. By default, your first _Backlog_ status will be the default status. To change that, hover over a different status in the Backlog or Todo categories and then select **Make default**.

### [Duplicate issue status⁠

](#duplicate-issue-status)

When you mark an issue as a duplicate of another, its status will change to _Canceled_. You can create a custom status in the Canceled category (e.g._ Duplicate_) and then configure workflow settings so that the custom status is applied instead.

### [Triage⁠

](#triage)

Triage is an additional status category that acts as an Inbox for your team. Triage is particularly powerful when combined with other integrations like Asks, Slack, or our support ticketing integrations. Learn more [here](https://linear.app/docs/triage).

## [Auto-close and auto-archive⁠

](#auto-close-and-auto-archive)

When enabled, auto-close will *close *issues that have not been updated in a set period of time.

Auto-archive controls when issues in the team will be archived. When an issue archives, its creator will be notified—this is an opportunity to unarchive if the issue is still relevant. Archived issues are still searchable and restorable in the future.

Archiving is only automatic and is not available as a manual action. More information about archiving is available [here](https://linear.app/docs/delete-archive-issues).

The auto-archive setting also controls when projects and cycles will archive.

# Create issues

Creating issues is the most common action taken in Linear.

## [Overview⁠

](#overview)

Issues are always linked to a single team. They have an issue ID (team's issue identifier and unique number) and are required to have a title and a status—all other properties and relations are optional.

## [Create an issue⁠

](#create-an-issue)

- Use the keyboard shortcut C to open up an issue creation modal
- Use V to create an issue in full screen mode.
- Click the **Create new issue** icon in the upper left of the app.
- To create an issue from a template use Option/Alt C, or hold Option/Alt and click the **Create new issue** icon.
- Enter [https://linear.new](https://linear.new) into your browser URL bar to create new a issue. It will redirect you to the new issue creation page as long as you are logged into your Linear account.
- Issues can be created using our [GraphQL API](https://developers.linear.app/docs/graphql/working-with-the-graphql-api). Many integrations in our [directory](https://linear.app/integrations) allow creating issues from other services using this functionality.
- If you have text highlighted when you go to create an issue, this will pre-fill in the issue title.

Changes made to an issue's properties in the first 3 minutes are considered part of the issue creation process, and won't be added to the activity log as changes to the issue.

## [Create an issue via email⁠

](#create-an-issue-via-email)

Issues can be created by sending an email to a unique intake email address that routes to a team. You can also create an issue via email based off a template.

A link to the original email will be included as an attachment on the Linear issue. Attachments will be synced over, though email attachments are limited to 25 MB.

The sender of the email will not be notified when the issue is updated or resolved.

Refer to the [Linear Asks](https://linear.app/docs/linear-asks) feature for the ability to:

- Customize the email address you want requesters to send to
- Reply to customer emails from Linear
- Customize response emails

#### [Create an email address⁠

](#create-an-email-address)

To create a email address for a Linear team, navigate to **Settings > Teams > General > Create by email** and enable the toggle.

#### [Create an email address for a template⁠

](#create-an-email-address-for-a-template)

To create an email addresses for a team template:

- Navigate to **Settings > Teams > Select Team > Templates**
- Click the three dots on the right of the template.
- Select **Configure email address**.
- Enable the toggle in the pop-up.
- Click **Continue**.

When a team template is used, the issue's title and description will be overwritten by the email contents, but the properties of the template will be applied to the new issue. Replies sent on the original email to the forwarding address will not create additional issues.

## [Create recurring issues⁠

](#create-recurring-issues)

You can create recurring issues to automate your repeated tasks on a cadence of your choosing.

### [Create a recurring issue⁠

](#create-a-recurring-issue)

When creating a new issue, you can choose to make it into recurring in the issue composer using the … menu and choosing _"Make recurring…"_

Creating a recurring issue from the issue composer[
](#collapsible-2de248468918)

### [Convert an existing issue into a recurring issue⁠

](#convert-an-existing-issue-into-a-recurring-issue)

To convert any issue into a recurring issue, open the issue and in the … menu choose Convert into > Recurring issue…You can also use the Cmd/Ctrl + K menu by typing _"Convert into recurring issue"_.
You can then choose your first due date, and the cadence at which it repeats.

### [Create recurring issues in team settings⁠

](#create-recurring-issues-in-team-settings)

Navigate to **Team settings > Recurring issues.**
To create a new recurring issue, click the icon and set your chosen schedule of recurrence.

### [Create recurring issues from templates⁠

](#create-recurring-issues-from-templates)

If you have an existing issue template you want to turn into a recurring issue you can do so.

First create your issue and apply your chosen template.
Once created, choose the options to convert to a recurring issue from the … menu or command menu. This issue will now turn into a recurring issue, and include any properties that were in the template, including sub-issues.

Recurring issues can easily be found from your **Team settings > Recurring issues**, or filtering your views using the **Recurring issues** filter.

### [Cadence of recurring issues⁠

](#cadence-of-recurring-issues)

Once you create a recurring issue, future issues in the cadence are expected to be created once the due date passes (00:01 the following day in your team’s timezone.)

Changes to a template in future will not affect recurring issues that were created from this template. You will need to edit the recurring issue directly or recreate it from your updated template.

## [Create a new issue URL⁠

](#create-a-new-issue-url)

The following links trigger the creation of a new Linear issue in any browser and you can add query parameters after any of them to pre-fill issue fields.

- [http://linear.app/team/<team ID>/new](https://linear.app/team/%3Cteam%20ID%3E/new)
- [http://linear.app/new](https://linear.app/new)
- [http://linear.new](https://linear.new/)

To pre-fill issue fields and/or properties:

- Add a `?` at the end of the link.
- Include the field or issue property you want to pre-set.
- Add `=`.
- Add the parameter you are setting.
- Use `&` between each field or issue property when creating a string of pre-settings.

### [Apply pre-set properties⁠

](#apply-pre-set-properties)

We support the following query parameters:

`title` and `description`:

- Use `+` to indicate empty space in the keyword, or fully url encode content if more complex as description can be a markdown document.
- For example, `https://linear.new?title=My+issue+title&description=This+is+my+issue+description`

`status`

- Can be set by `UUID` or name of the workflow status
- For example, `https://linear.new?status=Todo`

`priority`

- Can be set by Medium, Urgent, Medium or Low
- For example: `https://linear.new?priority=urgent`

`assignee`

- Can be set by `UUID`, display name/name of the user, or `assignee=me` to assign the creator
- For example, `https://linear.new?assignee=john` or `https://linear.new?assignee=Erin+Baker` or `https://linear.new?assignee=me`.

`estimate`

- Can be set by their point number e.g. `estimate=4`
- T-shirt sizes have the following point values: No priority (0), XS (1), S(2), M (3), L (5), XL (8), XXL (13), XXXL (21)
- For example, `https://linear.app/team/LIN/new?estimate=2`

`cycle`

- Can be set by `UUID`, cycle number of a name of a cycle
- For example, `https://linear.app/team/MOB?cycle=36` or `https://linear.new/team/EU/new?cycle=focus+on+bugs`

`label`

- Use a comma between each label you want to apply
- For example, `https://linear.new/team/LIN/new?label=bug` or `https://linear.new?labels=bug,android,comments`

`project`

- Can be set by `UUID` or the name of the project
- For example, `https://linear.new/team/LIN/new?project=Project+page+improvements`

`milestone`\* \*(a `project` must be defined)

- Can be set by `UUID` or the name of the project milestone
- Project milestone can be read only if `project` is also passed in the URL
- For example, `https://linear.app/team/LIN/new?project=Project+page+improvements&projectMilestone=Beta`

`links`

- URL encoded comma delimited urls with optional title, in format `url|title` . These will be attached to the issue as link attachments.
- For example: `https://linear.new/team/LIN/new?links=https%3A%2F%2Flinear.app%2Chttp%3A%2F%2Fgoogle.com%7CGoogle`

### [Create a URL from a template⁠

](#create-a-url-from-a-template)

- Go to **Settings > Team > Templates**.
- Click the three dots to the right of the template.
- Select **Copy URL to create issue from template**.

### [Copy a URL from an issue⁠

](#copy-a-url-from-an-issue)

While on an issue's view, or an issue is highlighted or selected, open command bar by typing Cmd/Ctrl + K and select **Copy pre-filled create issue URL to clipboard**.

## [Drafts⁠

](#drafts)

When writing an issue and navigating away to another part of the app, Linear will hide the issue modal and keep a temporary draft. The next time you go to create an issue, the editor will re-open with the previous content draft. This type of draft is saved locally and only available on the client used to create it. Logging out, restarting, or resetting Linear will clear this type of draft.

If you use Esc or click on the close button, a pop-up modal will appear giving you the option to save the issue as a draft. This draft type persists across clients and will not clear on logout or reset. To access your saved drafts, open the Drafts page in your sidebar.

Drafts are stored for 6 months before being deleted automatically

## [FAQ⁠

](#faq)

Can you create issues and use keyboard shortcuts in Safari?[
](#collapsible-2d4de9b5f74e)

If Safari is stealing your focus when hitting tab during issue creation, enable this Safari advanced preference:

Safari > Preferences > Advanced > Enable "Press tab to highlight each item on a webpage".

Safari Accessibility Preferences

Is there an attachment file size limit when creating issues through email?[
](#collapsible-df924442dd3b)

Email routing does not support sending messages with file sizes greater than 25MB. If you have attachments exceeding that, it will fail to deliver.

# Custom Views

Create durable filtered views of issues projects, or initiatives that you can save and share with others in your workspace.

Initiative views are available on Enterprise plans.

## [Overview⁠

](#overview)

Create custom views using filters to show only the items you want to see. Save, share and favorite these views for easy access and faster team collaboration.

## [Basics⁠

](#basics)

### [Open views⁠

](#open-views)

Open views in the team or workspace Views pages in your sidebar, or search for views to open with O then V.

### [Create views⁠

](#create-views)

To build a custom view from scratch, click on Views in the sidebar, select the type of view you wish to create (Issue, Project, or Initiative on Enterprise plans) and click _New view_.

You can also save any filtered board or list as a custom view with the keyboard shortcut Option/Alt V or by clicking on the Save view icon. The icon appears next to the Display Options icon after you've add at least one filter to any team-specific list or board.

### [Edit views⁠

](#edit-views)

To edit an existing view, click on the view name from within the view itself and choose the _Edit view…_ option in the pop-up menu.

You also have the option to duplicate an existing view from here, just click on the *Duplicate view... *option.

### [Share views⁠

](#share-views)

If a shared view is created at the workspace level, then the view will appear under Workspace views on the Views page. If you select a specific team when creating the view, then only members of that team will see the shared view and it will be listed under Team views in the View page.

To share a view across multiple teams but limit it to projects or issues within a specific team or teams, create an *All teams *view and use filters to refine the list.

### [Create views attached to Teams or Projects⁠

](#create-views-attached-to-teams-or-projects)

From your team's Issues and Projects sections, you can create new views to appear alongside the team's default views. These will be visible to all members of the team. Use the `+ Create new view` button beside the default or existing views to create additional views here.

### [Copy view link⁠

](#copy-view-link)

To share a specific view in Slack or wherever you discuss work, copy a link by clicking the custom view's three dot (more) menu and selecting _Copy view URL_ or by copying the View's URL in the browser. Sharing a link does not automatically give anyone access to a view, it must be shared first.

### [Favorite views⁠

](#favorite-views)

Favorite views that you access frequently to add them to your sidebar. Do this by clicking on the star next to the view name or from the overflow menu. Favoriting custom views lets you select them as your default page when opening Linear in [Settings > Account > Preferences](https://linear.app/settings/account/preferences).

### [Collapse view group headers⁠

](#collapse-view-group-headers)

Expand or collapse group headers when in list view by hovering over the group and pressing t, or clicking on the toggle icon at the left side of the group header.

### [View sidebars⁠

](#view-sidebars)

The righthand sidebar clarifies the view's contents and allows you to quickly filter for common properties. Project view sidebars display information on those project's leads, teams, projects, initiatives and health. Issue view sidebars display assignees, labels and projects.

### [Issue view subscriptions⁠

](#issue-view-subscriptions)

Configure personal or Slack channel notifications when an issue meets parameters defined by a view, or when an issue in a view is completed/canceled.

Individual notificationsSlack channel notifications

Click the bell icon at the top of an issue view. Select whether you'd like to be notified for when an issue is added to the view, marked completed or canceled, or both.

To reduce notification noise, you won't receive notifications in views you subscribe to for actions you take yourself.

Once you've configured a view subscription, manage the subscription in [notification settings](https://linear.app/settings/account/notifications).

Click the bell icon at the top of a view, then the _Configure_ button next to _Slack notifications_. Turn on the toggle and authorize Linear to post to a particular channel. Choose whether to be notified for when an issue is added to the view, completed/canceled, or both.

Moving forwards, notifications for these selected changes will be sent as messages to the chosen Slack channel.

### [View owners⁠

](#view-owners)

Every view has an owner property visible in that View's dedicated sidebar as well as on the main _Views_ page in Linear's main sidebar. This field defaults to the creator of the view but can be changed to other users as desired. Before deleting a view, we advise checking in with its owner to ensure it's no longer needed.

When should I use an initiative to group projects instead of a view?[
](#collapsible-034a76e781ed)

If you want to curate a list of projects for planning purposes that map to an organization goal or objective and you want to keep track of overall progress, an initiative is the ideal tool. The projects in an initiative are manually curated and do not change over time unless new projects are manually added or removed.

In Project views, any projects meeting the view's filter criteria will appear. Use project views to represent the current state of work, or as a quick way to keep an eye on particular types of projects you care about.

Example Project Views[
](#collapsible-def35a199b30)

**At Risk Projects**

See which projects are currently at risk to quickly spot projects that need attention.

At Risk projects

**
Quarterly review**

Look at projects completed last quarter and compare that to last quarter's planned roadmap. You can also share this view with stakeholders who need to know which features have launched.

Quarterly review

**
Projects by user**

Keep a list of your projects or projects or those of your direct report. Order projects by target date and look at the Status indicator to get a sense of when they’ll ship.

Projects by user

**Upcoming releases
**
Create a list of projects that are coming up for release by filtering for specific milestones (e.g. Alpha, Beta, GA).

Upcoming releases

**
Projects by initiative**

Filter by initiative to create a view of projects across different initiatives.

Admins can enable Customer Requests in [Workspace Settings > Customer requests](https://linear.app/settings/customers). Once enabled, anyone in your workspace can view customer pages, create and update customers, and add customer requests to issues and projects in Linear or from a supported integration.

When an issue is created from integrations with [Intercom](https://linear.app/docs/intercom), [Zendesk](https://linear.app/docs/zendesk), [Front](https://linear.app/docs/front), or [Asks](https://linear.app/docs/linear-asks), it will automatically add a request pointing back to the source. Requests can also be added manually and are viewable in their associated issue and the customer's page.

From settings, add further customizations. Choose a team to receive new issues created from a request by default (we recommend selecting a team [exclusively used to track feedback](https://linear.app/blog/how-we-think-about-customer-experience-at-linear#how-do-you-process-incoming-feature-requests)). You can also customize revenue units and tiers for different plans or products you offer. Revenue, Tier and Size fields will be automatically populated if you use the Intercom integration, or can be filled when creating customers manually.

## [Customers⁠

](#customers)

A Customer in Linear represents an organization using your product. Customers have a unique domain, name, logo, and attributes which can be viewed on their page.

### [Customer pages⁠

](#customer-pages)

Customer pages show all issues and projects with a request associated with that customer. You can group and order this list of issues to see what issues have been marked as important or what issues are in progress. Click on individual issues to open and view their request on that issue in full detail.

For customers created through Intercom or manually, you'll also see attributes like the customer's revenue, status, tier, and size on the customer page. Individual customer pages can be favorited so that they're easy to access from the sidebar.

### [Open Customer pages⁠

](#open-customer-pages)

- Use O then Q, then search for the customer's name
- Open the full customer list with G then Q, then search to narrow down results
- Search for the customer in the Cmd/Ctrl + K menu

### [Create Customers⁠

](#create-customers)

From integrationsManually

In most cases, customers will be created automatically through an integration at the same time their first request is created. Linear will use the customer's email domain to correctly map the request.

If your organization does not use these integrations, you can create Customers manually instead. To do so, open the command menu with `CMD + K`, then type `customer`, then Return

## [Customer requests⁠

](#customer-requests)

Customer requests link user feedback to specific issues in Linear.

### [Add requests to issues or projects⁠

](#add-requests-to-issues-or-projects)

A customer request is created automatically whenever you create or link to an issue or project from a supported integration. The request will appear both on the issue/project itself as well as on the associated customer's page.

From integrationsManually

When made from an integration, the customer request will quote the original message from the user. This request can be edited in Linear to add images, videos, or extra context. Requests also include a link to the source (e.g. Intercom conversation), name of the user associated with the request, and timestamp.

Requests can be created manually in Linear using the icon underneath an issue description, from the button on a customer page, or by using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl` `R` (macOS)/ `Ctrl` `Alt` `R` (Windows). This is useful when a request comes in through a channel not necessarily associated with an integration, like if you have Linear open during an in-person meeting.

From the project page, you can add customer requests using CTRL+R, or the + Customer Request button. Once your first Customer Request is added to a project, a dedicated tab for Customers will appear next to the Overview tab.

Remember to configure a default team in [settings](https://linear.app/settings/customers) for customer requests, so that issues are created in that team when requests are created from individual customer pages.

### [Integrations⁠

](#integrations)

The following integrations can create issues with customer requests:

IntercomZendesk & FrontSalesforceAsksSlackAPI

Requests are created when you create new issues or link to an existing issue or project from the Intercom integration. Customer attributes such as size and revenue can be synced with and managed from Intercom.

Requests are created when you create issues or link to an existing issue or project from Zendesk or Front conversations.

Requests are created when creating an issue from a case, or linking a case to an existing issue.

Whenever an Ask is created, a customer request will be associated with the issue and link the specific feedback and customer to the Ask. The customer association for Asks follows the email of the person who sent the first message in the thread, not the person who created the Ask.

If you have a Linear account and are creating an Ask in Slack, you can also select a customer manually. We do not expose your customer list to other users in your Slack workspace without Linear accounts, but if they create an Ask from the overflow menu on an existing message the customer association will be automatic.

To ensure proper customer attribution despite varying Slack privacy settings in shared channels, we recommend directly linking any shared Slack channels to the customer page (select the three-dot menu, then *link to Slack channel.) *This way, all Asks created in that channel will automatically be associated with the customer.

When creating an issue from the Slack integration, optionally select "Customer" to associate a customer request with the issue you are creating. This value will prefill if Linear is able to determine the domain of the user who sent the message.

To default a customer being selected in a Slack channel, open the customer page in Linear (O then Q) and from the … menu choose the "Link to Slack channel" option.

Requests and Customers can be created with [customerNeedCreate](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/Linear-API/variant/current/schema/reference/objects/Mutation?query=customer#customerNeedCreate) and [customerCreate](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/Linear-API/variant/current/schema/reference/objects/Mutation?query=customer#customerCreate) respectively in our GraphQL API.

However, using our API to import customer data from a warehouse—commonly done through an rETL pipeline—can be challenging, as GraphQL is not optimized for bulk data transfers, and Linear does not currently offer a REST API. We plan to offer better support for importing customers to Linear in the future.

### [Mark as important⁠

](#mark-as-important)

Requests can be flagged as important to specific customers. For instance, an issue or project may have requests from five different customers but be marked as important by only one of those customers. This binary indicator, shown as a triangle, lets customer-facing teams separate requests that represent a critical need from those expressing a nice-to-have feature.

### [Synced Attributes⁠

](#synced-attributes)

From _Settings > Customer Requests > Customer attributes data source,_ you can choose a data source for Linear customer attributes such as Intercom, Zendesk or Front and create mappings between source tool attributes and attributes on Linear Customers. You can also choose *None *as a data source to allow more control via the API or directly in the interface. Once an external source is configured the company name and domain are automatically synced.

_Owner, Revenue, Size, Status _&_ Tier_ can be remapped to pull from data in your source tool. These values are regularly kept up to date as they will be [synced with your source](https://linear.app/docs/customer-requests#collapsible-7589124828b2).

You can also choose to enable manual edits for any attributes that are unmapped. Attributes will always be editable via the Linear API regardless of this UI-specific setting.

## [Build customer views⁠

](#build-customer-views)

All customer data brought into Linear can be used to create [custom views](https://linear.app/docs/custom-views) for both issues and projects to surface the impact of your work on your customers. For example, create a view of issues with requests from Enterprise customers ("Tier" property from Intercom), where each issue has at least 20 requests. Ordering this view by customer count surfaces the most highly requested issues to the top. Triangle icons indicating requests marked important surface urgent needs. Consider consulting this view when planning upcoming cycles to ensure what you ship aligns with the needs of the users.

### [Notifications ⁠

](#notifications)

You'll receive Inbox notifications automatically when new requests are added to issues you subscribe to so you're always in the loop. Optionally, configure additional notification styles for new requests [here](https://linear.app/settings/account/notifications).

[Subscribing to custom views](https://linear.app/docs/custom-views#view-subscriptions) is the best option for more targeted alerts. For example, you might wish to stay aware of issues commonly raised by customers who churn. To track that, create a custom view defined by Customer status includes _Churned_, and ordering the issues by customer revenue. Click the bell icon to be alerted when a new issue is added to the view, or configure notifications to a Slack channel for greater visibility.
You can also open a specific customer page (O then Q) and under the bell icon subscribe to get notified when a request is added, marked important, completed or cancelled.

## [FAQ⁠

](#faq)

Which plans support Customer Requests?[
](#collapsible-f989a365835f)

Customer Requests is available on all currently offered plans: (Free, Basic, Business, and Enterprise.) You'll only be able to create requests from integrations available on your plan.

Create requestsFreeBusinessEnterpriseManually✔✔✔From Slack✔✔✔From Asks✔✔From Intercom, Zendesk, and Front✔✔From Salesforce Service CloudComing soon

Can I manage customer requests through the API?[
](#collapsible-8e406fe230a2)

The following actions are available through our GraphQL [API](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/Linear-API/variant/current/schema/reference?query=customers):

- Create/Edit/Delete customers
- Create/Edit/Delete customer request
- Create/Edit/Delete customer tiers
- Create/Edit/Delete customer statuses
- Query and filter customers
- Query and filter requests by issue/projects/priority/customer

Can I merge duplicate customers?[
](#collapsible-4ae6aa0c12e6)

Linear will prevent duplicate customers from being created in most cases. If you notice a duplicate instance, go to the customer page that you want to merge and select the *Merge with *option from the dropdown menu.

How do I block domains from creating customers?[
](#collapsible-2484e65b1f8e)

In [Settings > Customer requests](https://linear.app/settings/customers), exclude specific email addresses or domains to prevent them from creating a customer.

For example, add a domain to _Excluded domains and emails_ to prevent your own company from creating a customer. Internally, we've excluded `linear.app` here to prevent `Linear` from displaying as a customer when we create issues via integrations.

How do I avoid domains being associated with a customer?[
](#collapsible-2d5114d978cb)

You can prevent specific domains from ever being associated with a customer from [Settings > Customer requests](https://linear.app/settings/customers) and adding a domain or email under Excluded domains and emails.

Common providers like Gmail, Outlook etc. are automatically excluded. The full list of generic domains from common providers can be viewed here:

How does visibility of Customer Requests work across roles? [
](#collapsible-f9df112f6ceb)

Admins and Members will be able to see Customers Requests in Linear and in Slack in the dropdown menus on Asks and our Slack integration.

Guests see nothing relating to Customer Requests, including views that use Customer-related filters.

Users in your Slack workspace without Linear accounts will not see your customer list when using Asks, though we'll still match the Ask to a customer where appropriate based on the user domain of the original message's sender.

Can I stop Intercom, Zendesk, Front from creating new customers or customer requests? [
](#collapsible-fcf9286377ae)

In the integration settings for your support tool, you can toggle the setting off.

How often is data synced from an external source?[
](#collapsible-7589124828b2)

Intercom is synced in real time and all other integration sources are synced every 12 hours.

# Delete and archive issues

Linear archives issues automatically to keep your workspace uncluttered and easy to search.

## [Overview⁠

](#overview)

Linear offers features that helps to manage backlog and stale items in your workspace to streamline your focus on what's current. We introduce our auto-close and auto-archive feature, and talk about deleted issues and the team archives.

## [Delete issues⁠

](#delete-issues)

Delete issues with the shortcut Cmd/Ctrl delete, from an issue's contextual menu, or use command bar Cmd K and select **Delete issue**.

If you accidentally delete an issue, the fastest way to restore it is to use Cmd/Ctrl Z. If that isn't an option (e.g. it wasn't the last action you took), go to your team's archives > _Recently deleted issues_ and use the # shortcut to restore it. Recently deleted issues are stored in the archives for 30 days, after which they'll be permanently removed from your workspace. It is not possible to restore deleted issues after they have been permanently removed.

## [Auto-close⁠

](#auto-close)

Linear offers an option to close issues that have not been updated after a certain time period. This can be configured in _Team settings > Workflows_. When auto-closed, an issue is marked with one of the Closed statuses, we publish a history item to its Activity feed, and notify subscribers. You can re-open an auto-closed issue anytime by changing its status.

Issues will not be auto-closed until the associated cycle and project are completed.

## [Auto-archive⁠

](#auto-archive)

Archiving happens automatically with no user action required - there is no way to manually archive issues.

You can adjust the auto-archive time period, after which closed issues are auto-archived in _Team Settings > Workflow_. Changes made will apply within 24 hours, so if you have issues that have been completed for 2 months and change to a 1 month auto-archive schedule, you can expect to see those archive within the next day.

Projects and cycles cannot archive before their issues are archived. Once all issues are archived these entities are archived immediately afterwards.

### [Issues are not archiving⁠

](#issues-are-not-archiving)

There are some scenarios in which issues will not archive:

- Issues will not be archived if the associated cycle is not completed
- Issues will not archive if the associated project is not marked as Completed or Cancelled
- Sub-issues will not archive if the parent issue is not Completed or Cancelled

If a completed issue is blocked from auto-archiving for one of the above reasons, it will still need to wait the necessary auto-archive period when separated from the project, cycle or sub-issue in question.

For example, with a 1 month auto-archive period in place, an issue that's been done for 3 months in an active project will archive 1 month after the project has been completed.

## [The archives⁠

](#the-archives)

Each team has its own archives page where you will find archived or deleted issues, initiatives, cycles, projects, and documents. Access it with the shortcut G then X or find it in the sidebar under the three dot menu beside each team name. To keep the app speedy, archived issues are loaded on demand rather than stored in the client, so you may find the issues load a little slower on this page than elsewhere in the app.

### [Restore issues⁠

](#restore-issues)

Restore issues, projects, or initiatives from the archive in order to edit them.

# Display Options

Display options let you group and order issues and projects to determine which information appears in your view.

## [Overview⁠

](#overview)

Display options appear on every view in Linear. On issue views, they allow you to order and group issues in various ways, switch between board and list layouts, and choose which information is displayed. On project and initiative views, they control the layout between timeline and list views as well the grouping and ordering of information. Display options can be saved as personal preferences or as the default display options on that page for your workspace.

KeyboardMouseCommand menu

Shift V to open display options

Cmd/Ctrl B to toggle between list and board on issue views

- Select the _Display options_ button that shows up on the top right corner of a view. If the view does not have Display options, it is not supported for that view.
- To update for your view only, simply modify the display options (do *not *Set as default).
- Press Set as default to save the current display options as the default for other members in your workspace. It will be the view they see when they first open it, but they can always apply their own preferences on top of it.
- Press _Reset to default_ to revert back to the default (Saved) display options.

"Show display options"

## [Basics⁠

](#basics)

### [Saving display options⁠

](#saving-display-options)

To update your view only, customize the view and then navigate away from the options menu by clicking anywhere in the app. Your selections will persist even if you navigate away from the current view.

To update the display options on that page for your whole workspace, press _Set as default_ after customizing the view. This will apply the configuration to every other user in your workspace.

If you customize a view's display options and wish to return to the default configuration, Click _Reset to default._

### [Available display options⁠

](#available-display-options)

Every view in Linear is slightly different and will display different display options. _Triage_ and _Inbox_ only let you update the ordering and not grouping properties. We'll work to expand display options over time.

### [Issue view⁠

](#issue-view)

#### [Layout⁠

](#layout)

If a board is available for your view, you'll see the option and can toggle between lists and boards. Cmd/Ctrl B will also toggle the layout.

#### [Grouping⁠

](#grouping)

Grouping is allowed in most list views and lets you group issues by Status, Assignee, Project, Priority, Cycle or Focus\*. No grouping removes all categorization and is especially useful when applying ordering and filters. Grouping settings will affect whether you can order issues manually.

Beside each group in board or list view, you will see either the total number of issues in the group or the total estimate of all issues in the group. You can click this to toggle between either option.

*Focus is available in the *My Issue\*s view. Focus is a unique grouping that attempts to organize issues assigned to you in order of what you'd want to work on first.

#### [Sub-grouping⁠

](#sub-grouping)

Sub-grouping is available in lists and boards (as rows).
In board view having rows helps for a swim-lane style structure common in project management.

The grouping header will remain sticky as you scroll down so it's clear what grouping and sub-grouping you have in these views.

You can drag and drop issues between each grouping and it will automatically adopt the properties of that grouping.

#### [Ordering⁠

](#ordering)

Ordering is allowed in most list views and lets you order issues within their groupings by a number of properties, including Status, Manual, Priority, Last created, Last updated, Due date, and Link count.

You can also reverse the sort order of your issues, except when sorting manually or by status.

#### [Manual ordering⁠

](#manual-ordering)

Manual ordering is default for board views and can be selected in most list views. To move issues around, select them with your mouse and drag them to a new position. Manual ordering is unique in that it will update the manual order for everyone in the workspace.

#### [Sub-issues⁠

](#sub-issues)

Toggle this setting on to show sub-issues in the list or off to only show parent issues and issues without sub-issues.

#### [Show empty groups⁠

](#show-empty-groups)

When toggled, this setting will hide groupings without any issues.

#### [Display properties⁠

](#display-properties)

Choose what issue properties are displayed on individual issues on lists or the board. This is different from filters; filters will refine the list to only issues with certain properties while display options show all issues in the list but hide or show data on the issue item or board card.

Display properties include _Issue ID_, _Priority_, _Status, Labels, Project, Cycle, Created, Updated, Assignee, Estimate, Links, Sentry issues,_ and *Pull Request*s *and Commits. *On Enterprise plans, _SLA_ is also a supported Display property.

## [Initiatives and project views⁠

](#initiatives-and-project-views)

#### [Layout⁠

](#layout-2)

Switch between list view and timeline view.

#### [Ordering⁠

](#ordering-2)

Order projects manually, or by properties like status, priority or updated or created time. You can group by lead, member, status, health, start date, and target date in initiatives or in project views. You can also group by initiatives in project views.

You can reverse the sort order of your projects, except when sorting manually or by status.

#### [Zoom⁠

](#zoom)

Zoom the timeline view to focus on a month, quarter, or year. Use the mouse (two finger swipe on Mac) to scroll backwards and forwards in time.

#### [Completed projects⁠

](#completed-projects)

Under the active view tab, show projects that have completed in the last week, month, or year -- even if they've been closed. You can also select to show all projects no matter the status, or no completed projects in the active view.

# Edit issues

Making changes to an issue.

## [Overview⁠

](#overview)

All workspace members will be able to edit an issue's title and description, regardless of who is the original creator of an issue. For comments, only the creator of the comment will be able to perform additional edits.

## [Edit issue title and description⁠

](#edit-issue-title-and-description)

You can edit an issue title or description by clicking directly on the title or description and editing inline. You can also use the methods below when editing an issue.

## [Revert/Restore issue description⁠

](#revertrestore-issue-description)

If changes have been made to an issue description and you would like to revert to the original issue description or view changes that have been made, open the command menu with Cmd K and search for Issue content history… or choose the "Show version history" option from the ... menu on an issue.
The issue description history will be available in this option 10 minutes after a description has been modified.

## [Move an issue to another team⁠

](#move-an-issue-to-another-team)

When work needs to be passed over to another team, or when you are consolidating teams, issues can be moved to the appropriate Linear team within the same workspace.

For a single issue, simply use Cmd/Ctrl Shift M to move an issue to a new team. To move issues in bulk while retaining as much data as possible, select issues manually or with filters before moving them. Use Cmd/Ctrl A to select all issues on the list or board.

Cmd/Ctrl Z will undo moving an issue if you moved it by accident, but it will not undo the removal of issue data.

### [Old Issue IDs and URLS⁠

](#old-issue-ids-and-urls)

When you move an issue to a new team, we generate a new _issue ID_ and unique URL for the issue. Old URLs will still work and redirect to the new issue URL. Searching for old _issue IDs_ will also bring up the current issue (unfortunately, this doesn't work for old issue titles). Inline references to issues (like #ENG-123) will redirect when clicked, but won't update visually from the original issue ID they're associated with.

### [Changes in issue properties⁠

# Estimates

Show how much effort each issue will take.

## [Overview⁠

](#overview)

Use estimates to describe the complexity or size of an issue. Cycles and projects use estimates to calculate effort and related statistics. You'll opt into estimates on a team level as well as choose which estimate scale to use.

## [Configure⁠

](#configure)

Go to _Team Settings > General > Estimates_ to enable the feature. Teams can use different estimate scales and configurations, even if they're working together on the same project.

### [Scale range options⁠

](#scale-range-options)

ScaleExponential124816Fibonacci12358Linear12345T-ShirtXSSMLXL

When T-Shirt sizes require translation to numerical values (for display in graphs, for instance,) they follow the Fibonacci scale.

### [Extended estimate scales⁠

](#extended-estimate-scales)

Enable the extended scale to add two additional values to your scale.

Extended Scale Exponential3264Fibonacci1321Linear67T-shirtXXLXXXL

### [Zero estimates⁠

](#zero-estimates)

Allow zero estimates by toggling this option on in estimate settings. By default, we count unestimated issues as one point but you can disable this in estimate settings as well.

## [Add, edit, or remove estimates⁠

](#add-edit-or-remove-estimates)

Add estimates when creating or updating issues with the keyboard shortcut Shift E. The same keyboard shortcut can be used to edit or remove the estimate.

## [Filter for estimates⁠

](#filter-for-estimates)

Find issues with specific point values by filtering for estimates. The shortcut F will open the filter menu and you can select estimates from there. This is especially helpful when creating custom views and searching through the backlog.

## [Analytics⁠

](#analytics)

When you see the word effort, that refers to estimate. When estimates are not enabled, we calculate statistics using a default value of 1 estimate point per issue. T-shirt estimates map to the Fibonacci scale.

If you've enabled estimates, we'll use the estimate values to calculate percentage completion and effort in cycle and project graphs. The top bars on most views will show the total issues count or total estimate value next to the view's name. Hover over the number to see both values.

**When estimates are too large, refine issue scope**
Larger estimates usually mean that there is uncertainty about the issue's complexity. We find that breaking up issues into smaller ones is the best approach.

# Exporting Data

Export your workspace data using built-in tools, integrations, or the API

## [Overview⁠

](#overview)

Export data from your workspace to build custom reports, keep records, or input into LLMs.

### [Workspace CSV exports⁠

](#workspace-csv-exports)

Admins can export a workspace's issue data in CSV format from [Settings > Administration > Import Export](https://linear.app/settings/import-export) and click **Export data** at the bottom. There is a toggle option to include private teams, if any. This export action is recorded in the audit log.

This export contains the following fields for each issue: _ID, Team, Title, Description, Status, Estimate, Priority, Project ID, Project, Creator, Assignee, Labels, Cycle Number, Cycle Name, Cycle Start, Cycle End, Created, Updated, Started, Triaged, Completed, Canceled, Archived, Due Date, Parent issue, Initiatives, Project Milestone ID, Project Milestone, SLA Status_

## [Member list CSV exports⁠

](#member-list-csv-exports)

Admins can export the list of members in CSV format from your [Settings > Administration > Members](https://linear.app/settings/members) and click **Export CSV** button.

## [Issue view CSV exports⁠

](#issue-view-csv-exports)

Export a CSV of issues from any issue view, project or issue list using the Ctrl/CMD + K menu. In projects and custom views, this action is also accessible through the dropdown menu pictured.

Members can export up to 250 issues at a time while Admins can export views with up to 2,000 issues.

Guest users cannot export issues from a Linear workspace.

Command menuMouse

- When in projects or custom views, click the the project/view name and choose "Export issues as CSV…" from the dropdown\* \*

This export contains the following fields for each issue: _ID, Team, Title, Description, Status, Estimate, Priority, Project ID, Project, Creator, Assignee, Labels, Cycle Number, Cycle Name, Cycle Start, Cycle End, Created, Updated, Started, Triaged, Completed, Canceled, Archived, Due Date, Parent issue, Initiatives, Project Milestone ID, Project Milestone, SLA Status_

## [Copy issues as markdown for LLMs⁠

](#copy-issues-as-markdown-for-llms)

Copy issues and documents as Markdown with Cmd Opt C, or from the command menu. When copying an issue, this command captures its full context — including title, description, comments, and customer requests — in a structured format for use in AI chat tools.

Copy multiple issues at once by selecting them on a list or a board and using the same command.

## [Export individual issues as PDFs⁠

](#export-individual-issues-as-pdfs)

If you need to save individual issues as PDFs, use the Print dialog (Cmd/Ctrl + P) while looking at an individual issue to save an file in that format. On doing this, we'll automatically change the timestamps on each issue event from relative to absolute, which can be helpful if your auditors require seeing precise timestamps for each event on an issue.

## [Project and Initiative list CSV exports⁠

](#project-and-initiative-list-csv-exports)

Export a project or an initiative view as a CSV. This export type is available to members and admins. Please note if you attempt to export from the issues page of a project you will be exporting issues, not the project itself.

Command menuMouse

To export only one project or initiative, select just that single project before opening the Cmd + K menu.

For projects, CSV exports contain: _Name, Summary, Status, Milestones, Creator, Lead, Members, Created At, Started At, Target Date, Completed At, Canceled At, Teams, Initiatives_

For initiatives, CSV exports contain: _Name, Description, Details, Status, Creator, Owner, Target Date, Created At, Started At, Completed At, Projects, Teams, Health, Latest Update, Latest Update Date_

## [Integrations⁠

](#integrations)

Our [Airbyte](https://linear.app/docs/airbyte) and [Google sheets](https://linear.app/docs/google-sheets) integrations offer ways to export and sync your workspace data to those platforms so you can build your own custom reports. If you're interested in exporting data for analysis, consider using [Insights](https://linear.app/docs/insights) as well for in-product reporting.

## [API⁠

](#api)

You can also export data from issues, projects and more using our [API](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/Linear-API/variant/current/schema/reference), or work with Linear data using [webhooks](https://developers.linear.app/docs/graphql/webhooks).

## [FAQ⁠

](#faq)

Can I export teams?[
](#collapsible-df6b9bb698cf)

Teams can be imported from one Linear workspace to another. Please find steps to accomplish this [here](https://linear.app/docs/import-issues#linear).

# Favorites

Favorite views you frequently use.

## [Overview⁠

](#overview)

Favorites are personal shortcuts which appear in your sidebar.

KeyboardMouseCommand menu

O then F to open favorites

- Click the star next to issue, project, label, and custom views to mark or unmark favorite
- Click on favorites from the sidebar
- Hover over favorite then click `X` to remove it

`favorite` to favorite or unfavorite issue

`open favorite` to open favorite

## [Basics⁠

](#basics)

### [Applicable views⁠

](#applicable-views)

If a view can be favorited, you'll see the outline of a star in the top bar next to the view name. You can favorite the following views in Linear:

- Issues
- Users
- [Projects](https://linear.app/docs/projects)
- [Specific Cycles](https://linear.app/docs/use-cycles)
- [Custom Views](https://linear.app/docs/custom-views)
- [Label views](https://linear.app/docs/label-views)
- [Default views](https://linear.app/docs/default-views): all issues, active issues, backlog, board, current cycles, upcoming cycles.

Some views cannot be favorited, like the view of another user's issues that you see after clicking their name. Instead, you can create a custom view with filters to see the same issues, and add this to your favorites instead.

### [Add favorites⁠

](#add-favorites)

To favorite, select the ⭐ icon in the page header. You can also select the issue and search for the `favorite` command. Favorites do not always show up on contextual menus.

### [Create folders⁠

](#create-folders)

To create a folder for favorites, hover over favorites and click the icon to the right to create a new folder, or create from the ⭐ icon menu. You can give it a name of your choosing and easily drag any existing favorites in or out of the folder.

### [Access favorites⁠

](#access-favorites)

Once you favorite an issue, you'll see a _Favorites_ section appear in your sidebar above _Your Teams_. You can access favorites by clicking on them from the sidebar or searching for them in the command menu. The shortcut O then F will open a menu from which you can open a favorite, too.

### [Remove favorite⁠

](#remove-favorite)

Hover over the favorite in the sidebar and click on the `X` to remove it. This is not reversible but you can easily add the favorite again by going to the issue or view and selecting the star.

# Filters

Filters allow you to refine existing views and create custom views to show only the relevant issues.

## [Overview⁠

](#overview)

Our powerful filtering system lets you refine issue lists down to just the issues you need to work on. You can apply filters to almost every view in Linear and filter by almost any issue property. You can also apply various operators to filters and combine filters to show any or all.

KeyboardMouseCommand menu

F to open filter menu, then type to select filter _type_ and _name_ or quick filter by typing the name directly

Press F again to add additional filters. To refine operators on existing filters, use the mouse.

Backspace/delete to clear filters if filter panel is focused

Option/Alt V to save as custom View

- Click the Filter button in the top bar to filter any view
- Click the _X_ on a filter to remove it
- Click the button in the top right next to View Options that appears on filtered views to create a custom View

`filter` then `filter type` then select specific filters. To refine operators on existing filters, use the mouse.

## [Basics⁠

](#basics)

### [Apply filters⁠

](#apply-filters)

Type F to select filters from the command menu or click the Filter button above the board or list. You'll see a menu of filters that you can apply to the current view along with the number of matching issues. Once you've opened the filter menu, you can move through the menu or use free text search to find the exact filter you need.

### [Filter categories⁠

](#filter-categories)

You can filter by the following properties in Linear:

TypeFiltersIssue propertyPriority, Cycle, Estimate, Labels, LinksProject propertyProjectWorkflowStatus, Auto-closedIssue relationsBlocked, Blocking, Related, Parent, Sub-issue, DuplicateDatesCompleted, Created, Due, UpdatedUserAssignee, Created by, SubscribersOtherFilter by content

There are a few edge cases with workarounds:

- To filter for **no labels**, you'll have to select all labels and then switch the operator to _does not include_.
- To filter by milestones, filter by project first.
- You cannot filter for **suspended users**. To find issues assigned to or created by suspended users, navigate to their profile page (`linear.app/workspace-name/profiles/username`). If you do not know the username, an admin can find the link by clicking on the user's photo or name on the [Members list](https://linear.app/settings/members).

### [Quick search filters⁠

](#quick-search-filters)

If you know the specific name of the property you want to filter, you can type that directly and the filter will show up as a choice, saving you from having to click through the category to select it.

Property typeQuick filtersTeamTeam nameStatusStatus nameAssigneeUsernameCreated byUsernamePriority"High", "Low", etc.LabelsLabel or label group nameContentNo quick filters availableCycleActive, UpcomingProjectProject nameSubscriberUsernameRelationsThese are top level filtersDate filters"N days", Month, Quarter, Half-year, YearLinksFront, Zendesk, Intercom, custom link sourceMilestoneMilestone name

### [Filter with AI⁠

](#filter-with-ai)

Use natural language combined with artificial intelligence to filter your views. For example filter by phrases like "Show me issues assigned to me", "What issues are important?", " what issues are due next week" and so on, to have your views automatically filtered with the most suited parameters.

### [Build with operators⁠

](#build-with-operators)

Once you add a filter, refine it with operators. The filter type cannot be changed but clicking on any other part of the filter formula will give you options to change it and modify the query.

For instance, for a filter that says _Assignee is Andreas,_ clicking on _Assignee_ will do nothing, clicking on _is_ will give you the option to change the operator to i*s not*, and clicking on *Andreas *will show a selectable list to modify the assignee. If you add another assignee, Adrien, then you'll see the is operator change to _is either_ _of_ or _is not_.

We support the following operators in Linear, which will show up depending on the type of filter and selections:

- _is or is not_ when one option is included in the filter
- *is either of or is not *when multiple options are included in the filter
- *includes any, all, neither, either, *or _none_ for labels and links
- *before *or _after_ for date-related filters

### [Combined filters⁠

](#combined-filters)

Show results that match _any or all_ filters applied to a view. Once you add at least two filters, the option will appear in the top right sidebar. Click on the _all filters_ or _any filters_ wording to switch it.

### [Create Views⁠

](#create-views)

Once you've applied at least one filter to a view, you'll see a button in the top right appear that lets you create a View from the custom filters. If you click it (or use the shortcut Option/Alt V), you'll be taken to the View editor with those filters already applied. Learn more about [Views](https://linear.app/docs/custom-views).

### [Filterable views⁠

](#filterable-views)

Almost every view in Linear can be filtered with a few exceptions:

View

Filters

Search
Inbox
My issues
Reviews
Initiatives
Projects
Customers
Teams
Members
Triage
All issues
Cycles
Archive

Available

Views

Apply filters on any view and click to save to create a new custom view. You can also apply temporary filters on top of any existing view.

### [Filter with API⁠

](#filter-with-api)

For more complex filters or to build queries on the API, see our [developer documentation](https://developers.linear.app/docs/graphql/working-with-the-graphql-api/filtering).

# GitHub

Linear supports linking your GitHub pull requests, automating workflow statuses, and syncing issues between GitHub and Linear.

## [Overview⁠

](#overview)

The GitHub integration offers two core functionalities:

Link GitHub PRs

Sync GitHub issues

Automate your issue status by linking to a GitHub pull request or commit to follow their progress.

Sync Linear teams to GitHub repos of your choice, to automatically create and sync issues between Linear and GitHub. This will create a synced thread in the Linear issue so comments will sync both ways

This will only sync issues _going forward_. To import and sync historical GitHub Issues, refer to our [GitHub Issues Importer](https://linear.app/docs/github-to-linear).

### [Permissions⁠

](#permissions)

The integration requires the following permissions for PRs and Github Sync:

- Read access to checks and metadata
- Read and write access to issues and pull requests

For linking Linear issues via commits, we use GitHub webhooks to link commits, which do not require permission to reach your codebase.

## [Configure⁠

](#configure)

### [Required permissions⁠

](#required-permissions)

If you want Linear to have organization-level access to GitHub, a GitHub organization owner will need to install the integration. If you don't require GitHub organization-level access, a repository administrator can install GitHub.

### [Enable the Github integration⁠

](#enable-the-github-integration)

- Go to [Setting > Features > Integrations > GitHub](https://linear.app/settings/integrations/github)
- Click **Enable**
- Select the GitHub organization you want to connect
- Select **All repositories** or **Only select repositories** and choose the repositories you want to connect
- Click **Install**
- Authenticate into your personal Github account

#### [Github Enterprise options⁠

](#github-enterprise-options)

If it's relevant to your organization, GitHub Enterprise Cloud and GitHub Enterprise Server require additional setup compared to GitHub.com. See the following section for details of each.

Github Enterprise CloudGithub Enterprise Server (self-hosted)

If you're using GitHub Enterprise Cloud and have _IP Allow List_ security setting enabled, you'll also need to turn on _Enable IP allow list configuration for installed GitHub Apps_ setting to enable Linear's GitHub integration. [Read more here](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-allowed-ip-addresses-for-your-organization#allowing-access-by-github-apps).

Alternatively you can grant access to Linear's IP addresses:

`35.231.147.226`

`35.243.134.228`

We've expanded Linear's pull request automation to self-hosted GitHub Enterprise Server. You can now install the [new integration](https://linear.app/integrations/github-enterprise-server) to link Linear issues with a GitHub instance that's hosted in a custom URL. This integration doesn't require new firewall rules.

GitHub Enterprise Server will support the majority of the functionality of our existing GitHub integration with the exception of GitHub issue syncing and commit linking. [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) and Enterprise Cloud users should use our standard GitHub integration instead.

The table below provides a comparison of available features across GitHub.com, GitHub Enterprise Cloud, and GitHub Enterprise Server.

#### [Add multiple GitHub organizations⁠

](#add-multiple-github-organizations)

Click the **+** icon under _Connected organizations_ to add another Github organization. This will take you through the same flow as when you connected the first organization. Currently, we support multiple organizations for the PR automation only. You will only be able to use commit linking with a single GitHub organization.

It is not possible to connect multiple Linear workspaces to a single GitHub organization. This is a limitation on GitHub's side. GitHub Apps can only be installed once for a GitHub organization so this means only one Linear workspace can be connected.

### [Personal account connection⁠

](#personal-account-connection)

In addition to the organization-level setup, each member should connect their personal GitHub account. This ensures that the activity feed, synced comments, and assignees are mapped directly to the connected user in Linear, rather than appearing as generic GitHub activity.

To connect your account, open _Settings_ > _Features_ > _Integrations_ > _GitHub_ and locate the section showing your _Personal Github account not connected_. Move into connected accounts from there, and authenticate with your GitHub login under the _Github_ section. Once connected, all of your synced activity from GitHub will be attributed to you in Linear.

#### [Branch format⁠

](#branch-format)

Select the branch format you want to use when copying the branch name using Cmd + Shift + . from a Linear issue and pasting it into your branch name.

### [Enable commit linking⁠

](#enable-commit-linking)

- Turn on the toggle for **Link commits to issues with magic words** at the bottom of the GitHub settings page.
- Go to **Settings → Webhooks** in your GitHub organization or repository.
- Click **Add webhook** button
- Input the Payload URL and Secret provided in Linear, and select `application/json` content type. Leave "Push events" selected.
- Click **Add webhook**.
- Go back to Linear and click **Done**.

### [Configure GitHub Issues Sync⁠

](#configure-github-issues-sync)

Watch this video to see how Github Issues sync works:

Seek to:00:00 / Duration00:00

Remaining−00:00
0.25×0.5×0.75×1×1.25×1.5×1.75×2×

From the _GitHub Issues_ section of the [GitHub integration settings](https://linear.app/settings/integrations/github), click the **+** icon, then select the GitHub repo and Linear team to link.

You can choose to sync:

- **One-way**: issues created in GitHub will create a synced copy in Linear, or
- **Two-way**: issues created in either the GitHub repo or Linear team will create a synced copy in the other software

Multiple repositories can be connected to create issues to a single Linear team through one-way sync when issues are created in GitHub. However, only one repo can be configured for two-way sync at a time.

You can enable two-way sync when connecting a repo to Linear, or change this to another repo by pressing **... > Edit Link** on an existing repo connection.

GitHub Issues Sync will only sync newly created issues. To sync existing GitHub Issues, you will have to import them. Refer to the [Importer](https://linear.app/docs/import-issues#github-issues) page.

Properties that are synced between Linear and GitHub issues include:

- _`Title`_
- _`Description`_
- _`Status`_
  Please note that any custom statuses set at the GitHub Project level do not sync to Linear.
- _`Assignee`_
  Linear users can connect their Github account from https://linear.app/settings/account/connections to be synced as the issue assignee
- _`Labels`_
- _`Sub-issues`_
  Multi-level & cross-repository/team hierarchies are supported. If parent issue is not a synced issue (e.g. it's in a different GH repo/Linear team), the sub-issue can still get synced, but will have no parent issue set on the other end.
- _`Comments`_
  Comments made not in the synced thread of the Linear issue will not get synced to the GitHub issue. This allows for private discussions.

Moving GitHub synced Linear issues between Linear teams will maintain the synced relationship. You can also transfer GitHub issues between two synced repos; this will appropriately update the team of the associated issue in Linear.

To manually stop syncing, remove the attachment from the Linear issue through its overflow menu.

**Issue sync banners**

Once an issue is synced between GitHub and Linear, a banner will appear at the top of the issue to make this clear. The banners will display information to show current sync status or will surface any errors with syncing.

GitHub sync banners in Linear, showing issue #37 is connected and #34 had a sync error.

## [Linking Linear issues to GitHub PRs⁠

](#linking-linear-issues-to-github-prs)

You can link a Linear issue using pull requests or commits.

Watch this video for a quick demo on the available linking methods:

Seek to:00:00 / Duration00:00

Remaining−00:00
0.25×0.5×0.75×1×1.25×1.5×1.75×2×

### [Link through pull requests⁠

](#link-through-pull-requests)

Branch name

Pull request title

Magic words

Include `issue ID` in the branch name

Use the _Copy git branch name_ action or shortcut Cmd/Ctrl Shift . when viewing or highlighting/selecting an issue and paste it into the new branch name in GitHub.

Include the Linear `issue ID` (e.g. ID-123) in the title when creating pull requests.

**Method**

Use a `magic word + issue ID` in the PR description or title (e.g. `Fixes ENG-123` or `Fixes https://linear.app/workspace/issue/ENG-123/title`). If the issue is unassigned when linking takes place, you will be added as the assignee of the issue.

**Magic words**

Linear offers _closing_ and _non-closing_ magic words for you to customize your workflow. When using a _closing_ magic word, Linear will move the issue to _In Progress_ when the branch is pushed and _Done_ when the commit is merged to the default branch. When using a _non-closing_ magic word, the linked PR or commit will still move the issue through other statuses per Workflow settings, but will not automate the issue's status when the PR or commit merges. Instead, it will only transition the issue through to what’s configured prior to the _On PR or commit merge_ event.

The **closing magic words** are: `close, closes, closed, closing fix, fixes, fixed, fixing, resolve, resolves, resolved, resolving, complete, completes, completed, completing`_._

The **non-closing magic words** are: `ref, refs, references, part of, related to, contributes to, toward, towards`_._

## [Link multiple issues⁠

](#link-multiple-issues)

**Link multiple issues to one PR**

Include multiple issue IDs after the magic word in the description (e.g. `Fixes ENG-123, DES-5 and ENG-256`). Linking will happen after you save your changes. Magic words must be used in the PR description, they will not work if linked in a comment on the PR.

**Link multiple PRs to one Linear issue**

You can link multiple PRs to a single Linear issue using any linking technique. The Linear issue status will be updated when the final linked PR moves to the required state from your workflow.

For example if you have 2 PRs linked to 1 issue, you'll need merge both PRs before the Linear issue status will change.

### [Link using commits⁠

](#link-using-commits)

Use a magic word before the issue ID in commit message to link issues. We'll move the issue to `In Progress` when the commit is pushed and `Done` when the commit is merged.

## [Viewing a linked Linear issue⁠

](#viewing-a-linked-linear-issue)

### [Remove a PR from an issue⁠

](#remove-a-pr-from-an-issue)

To remove a PR from a Linear issue, open the issue, click on the three dots on the PR attachment, and select **Remove**. You can also do this through the command menu in Linear by viewing or selecting an issue, then searching for `git.`

To link a PR that is already open, modify the PR title or description to link an issue.

### [PR review state⁠

](#pr-review-state)

When individual reviewers comment, request changes, or approve your PR, we'll display their avatars and their actions on the GitHub attachment visible on the linked Linear issue. You can use this feature to quickly parse the review state of your PR without needing to return to GitHub.

If you request a team review instead of a review from specific individuals, we display "review requested" or "in review" on the GitHub attachment in place of user avatars.

### [Pull request preview links⁠

](#pull-request-preview-links)

If your PR contains one or multiple preview links, this will add a preview link shortcut to the Linear issue.

Preview links are automatically detected for popular platforms like Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare and AWS Amplify if you have connected Linear with your GitHub repository. We also support custom preview links: pull request descriptions and comments are parsed for any markdown links ending with "preview," once these are added by the PR author or a Github bot.

Multiple previews for a single PR are available in a dropdown menu, with customizable names and icons for easy identification (e.g. mobile and desktop previews). Icons are automatically chosen to reflect best their name, such as a mobile icon for mobile release links. Preview links are automatically removed after 30 days of inactivity on the PR.

**Pull request preview link accepted formats**

PR description textVercel Preview commentsNetlify Preview comments

Links that end with "preview" in your PR descriptions and comments will get added to the Linear issue as a preview link.
For example:

Vercel comments with the following format will be added as a preview link in your Linear issue.

Netlify comments with the following format will be added as a preview link in your Linear issue.

## [Workflow automation⁠

](#workflow-automation)

### [Issue status updates⁠

](#issue-status-updates)

Updates to PRs can automatically update the status of their linked Linear issues.

Watch this video to explore more about how issue status automation works:

Elapsed00:00

Seek to:00:00 / Duration00:00

Remaining−00:00
0.25×0.5×0.75×1×1.25×1.5×1.75×2×

You can customize the automation in _Settings_ > _Team_ > _Issue statuses & automations_ > _Pull request and commit automation_. Since this is a team setting, it must be configured for each team in your workspace.

You can configure status updates when PRs are drafted, opened, have a review requested, are ready for merge, and merged. By default, we will move linked issues to "In Progress" when PRs are open and "Done" when PRs merge.

### [Branch protection rules⁠

](#branch-protection-rules)

Once a review is requested, if you do not have [branch protection](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/managing-a-branch-protection-rule) rules set up in GitHub, the issue will skip the "review request or activity" state and move to "ready to merge”. Without branch protection rules, a PR is considered always mergeable. Please note that "ready to merge" automations will not fire if a "review request or activity" automation is not also configured.

### [Branch-specific rules⁠

](#branch-specific-rules)

You can also set custom workflow automations based on particular target branches.

For example, you can now configure that when a PR is merged to:

- `staging`, the issue status should change to “In QA”
- `main`, the issue status should change to “Deployed”

Branch rules apply only to target branches—the branch a PR is being merged _into_. Automations are not supported for source branches, the branch the PR is created _from_.

Watch this video to visualize how branch-specific rules work:

Elapsed00:00

Seek to:00:00 / Duration00:00

Remaining−00:00
0.25×0.5×0.75×1×1.25×1.5×1.75×2×

You can also override a default rule in a particular branch with “no action” if desired, so that issues linked to a change in that branch will not change status. Branch rules can be specified using regex, e.g: `^fea/.*` can set automations for all feature branches.

### [Auto-assign and move issue to start⁠

](#auto-assign-and-move-issue-to-start)

Save yourself a few steps by toggling on our automations that auto-assign the issue to you and move it to a started status when you copy the git branch name. To set up this automation, refer to [Preferences](https://linear.app/docs/account-preferences).

## [Other settings⁠

](#other-settings)

### [Linkbacks⁠

](#linkbacks)

When an issue is linked with a pull request, commit or GitHub Issue, Linear posts a linkback message as a comment with the issue title and description. All the pull requests are also listed in the issue details in Linear. This cross-referencing makes it faster to retain context without jumping between apps.

If enabled for private teams, the issue titles will not be included in the comment. The link will go to your Linear issue and be accessible only by users who are part of that private team.

### [Enable Autolink⁠

](#enable-autolink)

If you want to automatically resolve your Linear issue IDs (e.g. _ENG-123_) in PR descriptions or comment to links, you can enable this using GitHub's _Autolink references_ feature. See instructions on [GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/configuring-autolinks-to-reference-external-resources).

Use the following URL format: `https://linear.app/<workspace>/issue/ID-<num> `where `workspace` corresponds to your workspace's URL and `ID` is the issue identifier key for your team. You need to add each team separately as they all have a different ID pattern.

If you change your Linear team name/ID, you may need to reconfigure the Autolink settings.

## [FAQ⁠

](#faq)

My integration is not working.[
](#collapsible-038e5e50ce78)

If you get an error when setting up your GitHub integration, or it doesn't work:

- Disconnect the integration from GitHub's side.
- Open Linear in the browser and reset your local database by going to [https://linear.app/reset](https://linear.app/reset).
- Reconnect the integration in Linear settings.

These are the most common causes of errors:

- The integration got out of sync. In this case, reconnecting and resetting should fix it.
- You can only connect your GitHub account to a single Linear workspace. The workaround is to ask someone else from your org to set up the integration.

I get a notification in Linear every time a PR is open. How can I change this?[
](#collapsible-7b93baacd8a5)

Go to integration settings and remove linkbacks. This should reduce the notifications.

GitHub Enterprise Server integration isn't linking pull requests[
](#collapsible-57f683ac890d)

Make sure you completed the following steps during integration installation:

- Copied the provided *webhook secret *and saved it when creating the Linear GitHub App for your GHES instance. Without the secret, Linear is unable to verify requests
- Installed the newly created app to organizations and their repos you wish to link

If you missed the step 1 during installation, you'll need to Disconnect the integration inside Linear, and remove the installation inside your GitHub's developer settings, and re-install.

If you haven't completed the step 2, but successfully created the app, you can link new organizations and repositories under "Install App" in the application's developer settings.

If you have added new organizations, or repositories, they will also need to be linked to the application under developer settings under the "Install App" menu.

Why is my "Ready for merge" workflow not triggering?[
](#collapsible-0f9fcfdc21d5)

For the "Ready for merge" workflow to trigger, either review or checks are required within GitHub for this PR. Without either of these, the "Ready for merge" workflow will not trigger.

GitHub workflow settings

Does the GitHub integration support squash merging?[
](#collapsible-cfbf30fc7aba)

If you have already merged multiple PRs into a single branch and you want to merge that branch into a new branch, we will not auto-detect any Linear issues that were linked in the previous PRs. You will need to link each issue anew. You can do this by mentioning the Linear issue IDs in the new PR title or by mentioning them alongside magic words in the PR description.

How can I unlink a PR from a Linear issue when the branch name includes the issue ID?[
](#collapsible-707f3cb58aa6)

If your branch name includes a Linear issue ID, Linear will automatically link the pull request to that issue. Even if you manually unlink it, the connection can return when you push new commits or when the PR is merged.

To prevent this from happening, include the magic word `skip` or `ignore` followed by the relevant Linear issue ID in the PR description:

- `skip ENG-123`
- `ignore ENG-123`

This will fully unlink the PR and prevent status automation, even if the branch name still includes the issue ID.

# Importer

Learn best practices for importing to Linear. Select the tool you're importing from in the table of contents for specific instructions.

## [Linear Concepts⁠

](#linear-concepts)

A Linear [workspace](https://linear.app/docs/workspaces) is our top level concept, which contains one or many [teams](https://linear.app/docs/teams). We recommend that each company using Linear uses only one workspace.

[Issues](https://linear.app/docs/creating-issues) and [projects](https://linear.app/docs/projects) are the core entities used to manage work in Linear. Each issue belongs to a single team, while projects can belong to one or many teams. Other concepts in Linear can be scoped to a team or a workspace like [Views](https://linear.app/docs/custom-views) (filter based groups of issues or projects), [Initiatives](https://linear.app/docs/initiatives) (hand-picked groups of projects) and more.

When you import from another service to Linear, we'll attempt to match data from the source tool with the closest concept in Linear. If a concept from the source tool does not translate well to Linear, it may not be imported; please see details on your individual service for further details.

## [Pre-import best practices⁠

](#pre-import-best-practices)

Consider the below before starting your first import for a smoother experience.

### [Which data is worth importing?⁠

](#which-data-is-worth-importing)

If there is data that is no longer relevant to your organization's day to day work, consider whether it needs to be in Linear at all (perhaps a CSV of exported data from long-resolved issues is sufficient). Some organizations choose to use Linear as a "clean break" from their legacy tool and import only where absolutely necessary so they can start fresh with minimal clutter. Others prefer to maintain as full a historical record as possible in one place.

If you're importing when evaluating Linear instead of transitioning all at once, you may wish to run a pilot by importing just a few teams. We also have a resource for switching tools in our [switch instruction manual. ](https://linear.app/switch)

### [Choose an import method⁠

](#choose-an-import-method)

We offer two main methods of importing to Linear; our dedicated import assistants in-product and a CLI import tool. We recommend using the former whenever possible as they retain much more data from the original source, are easier to use, and provide the option to delete an import in bulk if desired.

Use the CLI importer when importing from a service that we don't have a dedicated import assistant for. Import assistants are available for Jira, GitHub Issues, Asana, Shortcut and Linear. More information about the CLI importer can be found [here](https://linear.app/docs/import-issues#trello-or-pivotal-tracker).

### [Understand the import process⁠

](#understand-the-import-process)

You'll first need to have an Admin role in Linear in order to access our import tools. You may also need high permissions in the tool you're importing from in order to access the data. In general, the import assistants follow this path:

StepDetailSetup Provide an access token, or sign in to your source tool from Linear. Choose an existing team to import to, or create a new team. Please note that you cannot import to a sub-team directly -- instead, import to a top-level team and convert it to a sub-team afterwards.ReviewWe'll display the issues, projects, labels, users and other data fetched from the information provided. Choose what to importChoose whether to import only open issues, or also to import closed and stale issues to the archive. The archive can be accessed through the overflow menu on each team in your sidebar.Map usersFor each user fetched, choose not to import them, to create a new user from an email address, or to map them to an existing user in your Linear workspace.ConfirmAt this point, all data available to import will be summarized. If it looks as you expect, hit Finish to start the import.

## [How to import⁠

](#how-to-import)

Find instructions on importing from your source tool below:

### [Jira⁠

](#jira)

Find instructions [here](https://linear.app/docs/jira-to-linear)

### [GitHub Issues⁠

](#github-issues)

Find instructions [here](https://linear.app/docs/github-to-linear)

### [Asana⁠

](#asana)

- Navigate to [Settings > Administration > Import/Export](https://linear.app/settings/import-export). You must be an admin in Linear to access this page.
- Click on the button for Asana.
- Enter your Asana personal access token. You can obtain your personal access token by navigating to your Asana [developer console](https://app.asana.com/0/my-apps).
- Enter your Asana team name.
- Select which Linear team to import issues into.
- Click **Next** to start importing.

An issue cannot belong to multiple projects in Linear, so one project will be chosen if issues are assigned to multiple Asana projects.

We currently only support in app importing from Asana organizations. Make sure your Asana workspace is an organization before beginning an import, or [convert your Asana workspace to an organization](https://asana.com/guide/help/workspaces/create#gl-convert-workspace) if it is not. If you do not want to convert your Asana workspace to an organization, use the CLI importer.

We'll map fields in Asana to these fields in Linear:

AsanaLinearPriorityPriorityNotesIssue description (converted to Markdown)Attached filesAdded to description, all files except images and videos are converted to linksTagsLabels (team-level)AssigneeAssigneeProjectsProjectsCommentsComments (markdown respected)StatusImported status will be Backlog or Done onlySub-issueSub-issueBlocked/blockingBlocked/blocking

### [Shortcut⁠

](#shortcut)

- Navigate to [Settings > Administration > Import/Export](https://linear.app/settings/import-export). You must be an admin in Linear to access this page.
- Click on the button for Shortcut.
- Enter your Shortcut personal access token.
- Enter your Shortcut team name.
- Select which Linear team to import issues into.
- Click **Next** to start importing.

We'll map fields in Shortcut Issues to these fields in Linear:

ShortcutLinearNameTitleDescriptionIssue descriptionTasksAppended to the descriptionExternal ticketsAppended to the descriptionStateMapped to the most similar Linear statusStory typeAdded as label (team-level)TagsAdded as label (team-level)OwnersFirst owner added as assignee when possibleEpicCreated as projectsCommentsCommentsEstimateEstimateDue dateDue datePriorityPriority

### [Trello, Pivotal Tracker, GitLab Issues⁠

](#trello-pivotal-tracker-gitlab-issues)

To import issues from these services,\* _use our open source CLI importer_.\*

For **Trello**, please note that imports must be run from individual board exports, not from the overall workspace.

While CLI imports can also be used to customize imports for services with an import assistant, we don't recommend this as the CLI importer will not import data supported by the import assistant like comments or projects.

Our [Command Line interface (CLI) tool](https://github.com/linear/linear/tree/master/packages/import) uses CSV exports from the source tool and requires some technical expertise. Access it at the link or from [Settings > Workspace > Import/Export](https://linear.app/settings/import-export). For those unfamiliar with the command line, [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cvjXN1c0oDgmtm0OZQyU1EXylDO2Oz2d/view?usp=sharing) video may help with getting started with a CLI import.

### [Linear⁠

](#linear)

To import data from one Linear workspace to another, first ensure that you have an admin account in both workspaces using the same email login credential.

If there isn't already an admin using the same email credential in both source and destination workspaces, invite an admin from the destination workspace to the source workspace (or vice versa) and have them run the import. For best results, avoid creating multiple accounts on the same workspace under different emails.

- Navigate to [Settings > Administration > Import/Export](https://linear.app/settings/import-export). You must be an admin in Linear to access this page.
- Click on the "Linear to Linear import" button.
- Select the workspace you would like to import. We will only show workspaces under the same email address where you are an admin member.
- Select the teams you would like to import from this workspace.
- Choose how to map members from the workspace you are importing from to your current workspace.
- Review a summary of the import.
- Click "Start import".

This import will not carry over all data associated with your source workspace. Please note that the data below will not transfer.

- Custom views / view preferences / views attached to projects or initiatives
- Favorites / reminders / drafts / inbox notifications
- Integrations\* / webhooks / OAuth clients / API keys (Integrations will need to be installed on the new workspace and will not resume notifications or automations for imported issues in most cases.)
- Billing/plans\* (please contact support@linear.app for assistance with billing transfers)
- Workspace URL (you can switch this manually after import)
- Personal and Workspace settings
- Roles (current admins will be imported as members, you will initially be the only admin. Guests will carry over with the same permissions.

### [Other⁠

](#other)

If you'd like to import from a tool not listed here, you can still do so using our [CLI importer](https://github.com/linear/linear/tree/master/packages/import) and the CSV file of your exported data.

First, you'll want to generate a Linear export file from [Settings > Administration > Import/Export > Export CSV](https://linear.app/settings/import-export). Remove any exported text but leave the headers of each column. This will give a CSV in the format that the CLI importer expects for a Linear import.

In the fields below, paste data from your source tool's export file, and save the CSV.

- `Title` - Issue title
- `Description` - Issue description
- `Priority` - Issue priority
- `Status` - Issue state (workflow)
- `Assignee` - Issue assignee (user's full name)
- `Created` - Issue created date
- `Completed` - Issue completed timestamp: please note that this will not appear in issue activity log, but will be stored on the issue.
- `Labels` - Added as a label (separate by commas for multiple labels)
- `Estimate` - Issue estimate: please note that these values only appear on the issue after enabling estimates on the imported issue's team.

Once the above data is in the attached format, you can import the CSV using the CLI and selecting the "Linear" CSV option when prompted.

For those unfamiliar with the command line, [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cvjXN1c0oDgmtm0OZQyU1EXylDO2Oz2d/view?usp=sharing) video may help with getting started with a CLI import.

### [Troubleshooting⁠

If something did not import as you expected, please check the section for your specific service to confirm whether we support importing that property. If the property is supported but didn't import as documented, please let us know at [support@linear.app](mailto:support@linear.app).

If you need to delete an import in order to re-import once more, you can do so through Import/Export settings, on the overflow menu on a specific import. If no overflow menu appears, please contact [Linear support](mailto:support@linear.app) for assistance deleting it.

Reimporting from the same external source to the same Linear team without deleting the initial import first will skip any already-imported issues.

# Issue documents

Create documents for issues.

## [Overview⁠

](#overview)

Create documents inside of issues to keep relevant information and updates in one central place. Use documents to create specs and provide additional resources to issues.

## [Create documents⁠

](#create-documents)

Create documents when inside of a issue under the `…` menu of an issue > Add Document. It will get added to the resources section of an issue.

In documents, you can type in plain text, use code snippets, format with headers and reference issues and projects.

## [Create document templates⁠

](#create-document-templates)

You can create document templates to write documents faster and guide creators to share information effectively. These templates can be selected when creating a new document inside a project or issue.

To create a document template, you can navigate to either the workspace template settings or team template settings. Once you've created the document template, press save to make the template available for your team and workspace members.

To edit, duplicate or delete a template, go to the same page where you created the templates and then hover over the template name in order to show contextual controls. Click on the overflow menu and take the desired action.

## [Document subscriptions⁠

](#document-subscriptions)

You can subscribe to notifications for specific documents by clicking on the bell icon in the upper right of the document and selecting yourself or another team member to notification.

The creator of a document will be automatically subscribed to the changes in the document.

Notification types include document changes, comments, and replies. You do not get a notifications for actions you have taken on a document, but you will receive notifications for when

- A comment or reply has been made in a document.
- Material changes to the content of a document.
- A document was deleted.
- A team member subscribes or unsubscribes you to a document.
- A team member mentions you in a document
- A team member mentions you in a comment

## [Inline comments⁠

](#inline-comments)

Select text and press the comment button, or use Cmd Opt M to leave a comment. Subscribed or mentioned members will receive notifications about comments and replies.

Reply to comments, or resolve them with a single click.

The full comment history of a document is available in the chat bubble icon in the upper right.

## [Collaborative editing⁠

](#collaborative-editing)

Edit documents by opening them and clicking anywhere in the editor to begin editing. We'll show when the document was last edited and by whom. Linear offers collaborative editing, so you'll see input cursors if another user is editing or viewing the text. All changes are instantly saved and synced to everyone in realtime. You can revert documents to a previous version in the … menu at the top and choosing _"Revert document content"_.

## [Editor slash commands⁠

](#editor-slash-commands)

Type / to see additional formatting options in documents (and issues.) Using this menu you can create formatting types including:

- Headers (H1, H2, H3)
- Lists (bulleted, numbered, checklists)
- Codeblocks
- Dividers
- Blockquotes

## [Open documents⁠

](#open-documents)

While in an issue view, you can open documents with the shortcut O then D or by selecting the relevant document from the Resources section in an issue.

## [Reference documents⁠

](#reference-documents)

Reference documents in issue descriptions, comments, and even in other documents by typing @\*\* \*\*while in edit mode followed by the document name. This action can also be used to reference issues or projects; matching documents will appear in the lowest section.

## [Link to headers⁠

](#link-to-headers)

To copy a URL to a specific header, hover over the left side and click _Copy heading URL_. Sharing this URL with a colleague in your workspace will direct them to this specific section.

# Issue relations

Create relationships between issues such as blocking, related, and duplicate.

## [Overview ⁠

](#overview)

Tag issues with relations and dependencies to help your team identify and remove blockers and work on the most important issues. You can mark issues as blocked, blocking, related, and duplicate.

## [Add relationships⁠

](#add-relationships)

The issue and type of relationship will show up in the issue properties sidebar.

From the issue editor, add a relation using keyboard shortcuts or by selecting the overflow menu after saving the issue. From a list or board, use either the keyboard shortcut, command menu or contextual menu. You'll be prompted to find and select the related issue. You can add as many related, blocking, blocked, or duplicate flags as you like but will have to repeat the steps for each one.

## [Related issue⁠

](#related-issue)

When you reference issues in a description or comment, they'll automatically become a related issue. Alternatively, use M + R to relate one issue to another. When viewing an issue you can open the command menu (⌘/CTRLK) and type _"Create new issue related to…"._

To remove a related issue, hover over the related issue and click the *X. *You can also select _Remove relation_ from the command menu ⌘/Ctrl K. If you have more than one relation, you'll be prompted to select which relation to remove.

## [Blocked / blocking⁠

](#blocked-blocking)

Mark issues as blocked by other issues with M then B. If other issues are blocking the current issue, they'll show up in the issue sidebar with an orange flag under* Blocked by*.

Mark issues as blocking other issues with M then X. If the issue is blocking other work, the blocked issues show up in the issue sidebar with a red flag under* Blocks*.

Once the blocking issue has been resolved, the blocked issue flag turns green and moves under _Related_.

## [Duplicate⁠

](#duplicate)

Merge duplicate issues into the canonical (saved) issue with the shortcut by pressing M and M. This will mark the issue you are viewing or have selected as a duplicate issue and change the status to canceled. You cannot mark issues the other way around (e.g. view the canonical issue and mark other issues as duplicates of it). If you have more than one canceled status, you can specify which status to apply under _Team Settings > Workflow_.

# Issue templates

Templates speed up issue creation, ensure properties are applied when necessary, and facilitate reporting.

## [Overview⁠

](#overview)

Templates help you file issues more quickly, and ensure desired issue properties are applied without having to add each one manually. When a template is set as default for a team, each new issue in that team will be created from that template unless manually changed.

## [Create an issue template⁠

](#create-an-issue-template)

Create new templates by navigating to either [_Workspace settings > Templates_](https://linear.app/settings/templates) or _Team settings > Templates_.

Workspace TemplatesTeam Templates

You can create issues with a workspace template on any team in your workspace. Team specific properties like team labels or issue statuses cannot be preset in a workspace level template.

Use workspace templates for issue types that are likely to appear across different teams

When a template is scoped to a particular team, it's available only when creating issues in that team. This template type has full access to team properties like team labels and issue statuses.

Team templates are commonly used in our Asks integration, or for types of issues should always be filed to only one team in your Linear workspace.

## [Use issue templates⁠

](#use-issue-templates)

The fastest way to create an issue by template is to use the keyboard shortcut Option/Alt C, which brings up a list of available templates. Alternatively, access templates directly from the issue creation modal by clicking on _Template_ next to the team name.

To apply a template in a sub-issue, from the sub-issue creation modal, click on the square icon in the top right, which will show you a list of possible templates.

If you don't see the template, check that you're creating the issue from the right team. In a sub-issue, it will only show templates that do not already contain sub-issues as an option to apply.

## [Default templates⁠

](#default-templates)

Configure default templates from a team's template settings page. Taking this action will cause each new issue on that team to have the set template applied by default. You can configure defaults differently for members of your team or people who are not part of your team.

## [Placeholder text⁠

](#placeholder-text)

If you want to prompt the creator to input information in the issue's description, consider using placeholder text in your template.

To format text as a placeholder, select text while editing your template and click the Aa icon on the formatting bar. This formatting type is only available when creating or editing templates.

Placeholder text is particularly useful when formatting templates designed to be used as Asks, so you can define custom sections to receive more structured issues. Read more about Asks [here](https://linear.app/docs/linear-asks#customize-templates).

## [Templates in integrations⁠

](#templates-in-integrations)

Templates created in Linear can also be used in integrations to help save time and keep properties applied consistently where needed.

IntegrationUse-caseIntercom & ZendeskSupport agents can select a template for the type of issue being reported, speeding up filing and prefilling needed properties like status Triage and label Bug SlackWhen creating issues from a Slack message, select a template from the dropdown menuAsksAsks is designed to be primarily template driven; users outside your Linear workspace but in your Slack workspace create issues via template enabled in Asks, so their issues end up with the necessary data in LinearZapierConsider creating issues via template in the Create Issue step for Linear in Zapier for more complex, multi-application workflowsEmailTemplates can have unique email addresses; sending an email to that address will create an issue with the properties of the template

Add a template to a supported integration by using the overflow menu on the template (in team or workspace settings, depending on where the template was configured.)

## [Template based Insights⁠

](#template-based-insights)

Issues created by template are filterable by their template, regardless of where they were created. For example, for a template Bug Report, filtering for that template will return issues created with that template in created in Slack with our Slack or Asks integrations, Intercom/Zendesk, and Linear's interface. Questions like "What's our breakdown of bug reports vs. feature requests look like, and how many of them are solved" can be explored with [Insights](https://linear.app/docs/insights):

Or, investigate the breakdown of template use by intake source:

# Label views

Label views show all issues under a specific label or label group.

## [Overview⁠

](#overview)

Label views show you all the issues associated with a label.

KeyboardMouseCommand menu

O then L to open a label view

Click on a label from an issue, board, or list to open the label view

`open label` to open a label view

## [Basics⁠

](#basics)

To open a label view, click on the label or label group from a board, list, or issue view. You can also use O then L to launch a menu and select the label view. You can favorite label views as well as filter them. Team-specific label views only show issues in the specific team associated with the label, whereas workspace label pages show issues associated with the label from all teams.

### [Workspace labels⁠

](#workspace-labels)

If multiple teams have a a team-specific label (e.g. _Design_), and you want to view all issues with the same label across these teams, it is possible to use filters and custom views to do so.

To set this up, create an* All teams* view, then apply a filter for the specific label. Make sure the label is spelled exactly the same across all teams, though capitalization and label color don't matter.

# Labels

Use labels to categorize issues.

## [Overview⁠

](#overview)

### [Labels⁠

](#labels)

Labels allow you to organize issues. Create them scoped to the workspace or a specific team level, so they're available only where relevant. You should create labels that are used by all teams (e.g. "Bug") in the workspace-level, so they will be accessible to all teams.

### [Label groups⁠

](#label-groups)

Label groups create one level of nesting in your workspace and team labels, giving you more options when organizing issues. Each label group is limited to 250 labels.

Please note that labels within groups are _not multi-selectable_, so when applying labels to issues only one label from each group may be applied.

## [Create labels⁠

](#create-labels)

Create labels in [Settings > Workspace > Labels](https://linear.app/settings/labels) page or _Team settings > Labels_.

### [Create a label during add label workflow⁠

](#create-a-label-during-add-label-workflow)

You can also create labels in the _Add label_ flow. Take the action to apply a label, then type the name of the label you want to create. The label will be automatically be saved to your team's labels.

If you'd like to create a label or label group directly from the _Add label_ flow, this is available with the syntax `label group`_/`label`_ or `label group:*label*` . For example, using _Type/Bug or Type:Bug _ will create the label group "Type" and the label "Bug".

## [Apply labels⁠

](#apply-labels)

Apply labels to any issue with the shortcut L, or by clicking into the label property field in an issue's right sidebar.

## [Manage labels⁠

](#manage-labels)

Labels can be edited, merged, and deleted in issue label settings. Label data like SLA and Triage rules the label's used in, when it was last applied, and how many issues have that label appear in settings to guide your choices.

In workspace label settings, optionally select to display both all team and workspace labels on that page for ease of editing. Or, in larger workspaces, search for particular labels to assist in cleanup.

Edit label name or color by clicking on those properties in a label row. Or, right click on the row to see additional options like converting to a group, moving to workspace, or deleting the label.

Take bulk actions by selecting multiple labels (x or Shift + click), then right-clicking on any selected label to choose an action. You can move rescope labels to and from the workspace level to a particular team, or change a label's team. If you find duplicates, merge multiple labels into a single label.

### [Label descriptions⁠

](#label-descriptions)

Add brief label descriptions in label settings. These descriptions appear when you hover over an applied label anywhere in Linear. These descriptions give a consistent understanding of when a label should be applied. [Product Intelligence](https://linear.app/docs/product-intelligence) also considers label descriptions to inform whether to suggest a particular label.

### [Archive labels⁠

](#archive-labels)

Archiving a label keeps it on any issues where it's been applied, but stops people from using that label moving forward. Views, insights, filters and groups all respect archived labels. Take this option when you no longer need a label actively, but you want to retain historical context.

Archive labels in label settings, through the overflow menu on a particular label's row.

### [Delete labels⁠

](#delete-labels)

If you're sure a label no longer needs to exist, you can also delete it. Deleting labels is not reversible (including by Linear support) and will remove it from issues where it's applied, so please proceed with caution.

Delete labels in label settings, through the overflow menu on a particular label's row.

## [Filtering and views⁠

](#filtering-and-views)

Team-specific labels "act" like workspace labels when filtering all teams or multi-team views. As long as labels in different teams share the same name,\* *filtered results will show all issues across all teams that match the label. This holds true in custom views, my issues, project all team view*s\*, and general search (/). It does not extend to the API (you'll have to use the unique identifier for each team's label).

If you only want to see results for a specific team's labels in a multi-team view, add a team filter on top of the label filter. Creating a workspace label with the same name as existing team label(s), will present the option to convert the team label(s) to the workspace level.

Learn more about [Label views](https://linear.app/docs/label-views) and how to [filter](https://linear.app/docs/filters) for labels.

## [Reserved label names⁠

](#reserved-label-names)

We reserve the following label names that are duplicative of existing features to not cause confusion:

"assignee", "cycle", "effort", "estimate", "hours", "priority", "project", "state", "status",

# Notifications

Receive alerts on important updates to desktop, mobile, Slack or email.

## [Overview⁠

](#overview)

You will always be notified for all notification types to your Linear inbox. Optionally, configure additional desktop push notifications, personal Slack notifications, mobile notifications and email digests.

## [Configure⁠

](#configure)

Go to [Settings > Account > Notifications](https://linear.app/settings/account/notifications) to manage your notifications.

You can customize for the types of updates you'd like to receive from Linear such as changelogs, DPA updates and other communications.

Notification are categorized into their methods: Desktop, Mobile, Email, and Slack. A green dot next to a method will signify this method is enabled an a gray dot will signify it is disabled.

To enable a notification, click into the method and click the toggle to turn on the notification. Below will be a list of the types of notifications for that method you want to receive.

Notifications are grouped. For example, if you want notifications for status changes on an issue, you will be notified if the status, priority, or blocking relationship of that issue has been changed. You cannot select _only_ status changes.

## [Notification timing⁠

](#notification-timing)

Desktop, mobile and Slack notifications are sent in real-time. Email digests send with time delays based on urgency, and are only sent if you haven't already read the Linear inbox notification.

### [Email digests⁠

](#email-digests)

Email digests send a summary of unread notifications. They're configured to send out after a certain amount of time has elapsed depending on properties such as issue status.

You can opt to send a notification email immediately if an issue assigned to you is marked urgent or breaches SLA and/or delay low priority emails outside for work hours until the next day. Work hours are defined as 8 am - 6 pm in your timezone.

## [Subscribing to an issue⁠

](#subscribing-to-an-issue)

Subscribing to an issue will determine whether you will receive a notification for that issue based on your notification preferences. You are automatically subscribed to an issue when you create them, are assigned to them, are @mentioned in an issue comment or description, or if you use the menu in the Activity section to subscribe manually. If you are @mentioned in a comment in an issue thread, you will be automatically subscribed to the thread, but not to the overall issue.

To manage subscriptions, open issues individually and then press Shift S to subscribe or Cmd/Ctrl Shift S unsubscribe. View all subscribed issues under [My Issues > Subscribed](https://linear.app/my-issues/subscribed).

## [FAQ⁠

](#faq)

My notifications are enabled. Why am I not receiving them?[
](#collapsible-05d3eea19e51)

If you have Linear open in multiple tabs or both the Desktop and website app open, it's possible that notifications are sent to one but not the other. The workaround is to only use one version of Linear at a time. If none of those apply, please reach out to our support team.

If you're a Safari user, see the Q&A about notifications for browsers. Unfortunately, Safari does not support Push API which we use to send desktop notifications.

How can I re-enable notifications if I disabled them in my browser?[
](#collapsible-5cab66608fbf)

If you disabled them in the browser you might need to go through your browser settings and clean up the site preferences. If you're using Chrome, update settings here: `chrome://settings/content/notifications?search=notifications` and then re-enable in Linear.

Why isn't the red badge showing up on the Linear icon in my dock?[
](#collapsible-6ae909e4ad93)

Please check that you've enabled notifications for Linear in the macOS settings as well as marked to show the red badge icon.

What status changes generate notifications?[
](#collapsible-2b6053fecc38)

When "Status changes" is selected in Notification settings, issue completions and cancelations will notify you if you subscribe to the issue.

If you wish to configure notifications for issues entering a specific status, consider setting up a [view subscription](https://linear.app/docs/custom-views#view-subscriptions).

Is there a limit to how many notifications you can keep in your inbox?[
](#collapsible-e7ffc5256e66)

We will retain up to 500 notifications in your inbox. If you have more than 500 notifications, we will only keep the most recent 500 and remove any older notifications.

# Parent and Sub-Issues

Use sub-issues to break down larger "parent" issues into smaller pieces of work.

## [Overview⁠

](#overview)

Consider creating sub-issues when a set of work is too large to be a single issue but too small to be a project. Sub-issues are also ideal for splitting up work shared across teammates. When you add a sub-issue to another issue, the other issue becomes its "parent".

## [Create a sub-issue⁠

](#create-a-sub-issue)

Create a sub-issue by opening the parent issue and click the `+ Add sub-issues` button below the issue description. This will launch the sub-issue editor. You can also use the shortcut Command Shift O to open the editor.

You can also create sub-issues in the issue creation modal (C) by pressing Command Shift O to open the editor or under the ... menu and _"Add sub-issue". _

When you save a sub-issue, it will automatically launch the editor to create a new one. If you want to create a new one with the same values (labels/assignee etc.) you can press ⌘ Shift Enter or Shift+ click the save button. Press Esc to exit the sub-issue editor and continue updating the parent issue.

You can turn a comment under an issue into a sub-issue by hovering over a comment and clicking the … menu then *"new sub-issue from comment". *Selecting a comment's text and pressing ⌘ Shift O will also create a sub-issue.

If you have a list (bulleted, numbered or checklist) you can highlight the checklist and hit ⌘ Shift O to convert to sub-issues or choose the _"Create sub-issues(s) from selection"_ item in the formatting toolbar.

You can add a template using the templates icon when creating a sub-issue or using the command menu under "Create new sub-issue from template" when viewing the parent.

## [Copy properties⁠

](#copy-properties)

Sub-issues created in the editor automatically copy issue properties from the parent issue such as the project and cycle _as long as those are set before you create the sub-issue_.

Team, labels and assignees are not copied over. You can't create sub-issues while editing the parent issue, but the option will come up once you press save.

You can duplicate a parent and its sub-issues from the Parent's ... menu under *"Duplicate" *and hit the toggle _"Include sub-issues"._

## [Status automation⁠

](#status-automation)

Optionally, configure the following behaviors at the team level (Settings > Team > Workflow) to automate status relations between parent and sub-issues. Status changes triggered by Git integrations will also respect these automations.

**Parent auto-close**

When all sub-issues are marked as done, the parent issue will also be marked as done automatically.

**Sub-issue auto-close**

When the parent issue is marked as done, all remaining sub-issues will also be marked as done.

## [Converting issues⁠

](#converting-issues)

### [Turn issues into sub-issues⁠

](#turn-issues-into-sub-issues)

Turn an existing issue(s) into sub-issues of another issue by selecting one or multiple issues and then taking the action to set the parent issue. This action is accessible from the command menu or by pressing Cmd Shift P and selecting a parent issue.

### [Turn issues into parent issues⁠

](#turn-issues-into-parent-issues)

To make an existing issue a parent issue of another issue, hover over a sub-issue and take the action _"Set Parent"_ in the contextual menu, command menu or ... menu.

### [Turn sub-issues into issues⁠

](#turn-sub-issues-into-issues)

You can turn a sub-issue into a regular issue again using the ⌘/ctrlK menu option "Remove parent".

### [Turn issues into projects⁠

](#turn-issues-into-projects)

Sometimes an issue grows so large it's more appropriate to turn it into a project instead. To do so, hover over the parent's ... menu and choose "_Convert to project."_ The project will inherit its details from the original parent issue, and former sub-issues will become standard issues in the project.

## [Filter sub-issues⁠

](#filter-sub-issues)

You can usually set the view to show or hide sub-issues in [Display Options.](https://linear.app/docs/display-options) You can also use [Filters](https://linear.app/docs/filters) to show only top-level (parent) issues, issues with sub-issues, or only sub-issues. If you use these filters frequently, consider creating a [custom view.](https://linear.app/docs/custom-views)

You can also hide completed sub-issues by default under the ... menu and toggling "Always hide completed sub-issues".

You can also sort your sub-issues under an issue from the … menu and *"Order by" *though this only updates it for the current user, not globally.

## [Display options⁠

](#display-options)

When looking at sub-issues from the context of their parent issue, you can customize the order of the sub-issues and the properties that display.

# Peek preview

View issue details without having to open issues.

## [Overview⁠

](#overview)

Peek is one of the semi-secrets of the Linear UI. It lets you view details of focused issues at a glance from any list or board view, similar to Quicklook in macOS.

KeyboardMouseCommand menu

Tap Space to toggle peek on or off

Space and _hold_ to turn on peek only while Space is depressed

Peek can only be launched with the keyboard shortcut

Peek can only be launched with the keyboard shortcut

## [Configure⁠

](#configure)

Peek is a default setting in Linear available on many issue and project views. If peek is available for your page or view, you can launch it by pressing the Space bar and turn it off by pressing the Space bar again. To temporarily turn it on, hold the Space bar down. Peek will remain active until you let go of the Space bar.

## [Basics⁠

](#basics)

Press Space to launch peek, then scroll through a list or board with (J/K or ↑/↓) to launch the peek pop up. The peek preview will show information based on the items

- For issues, it will show a preview issue details including the description, assignee, status, priority, cycle, labels, estimate, creation date, and updated date.
- For projects, peek will show project details as well as the project graph.

## [Quick look⁠

](#quick-look)

When you have projects or issues in view in the Cmd/Ctrl + K menu, get a preview without opening it by using quick look -- a variation on peek. When available, this is triggered by the right arrow key and adds a preview to the right side of the command menu.

# Priority

Set issue priority to indicate which issues to complete first.

## [Overview⁠

](#overview)

Priority is an optional property for Linear issues to signify to your team the urgency of the issue. You can add the following priorities to issues: low, medium, high, and urgent.

We don't have the option to set custom priorities or more granular priorities since it's easy to get carried away with specificity. Adding too many options makes it harder to set priority and leads to diminishing returns. If more granularity is needed, the best workaround is to create additional workflow statuses or use labels.

## [Set priority⁠

](#set-priority)

Select an issue or issues or from the issue view, type P and then select the issue priority. Use the shortcut again to change or remove the priority.

## [Priority ordering⁠

](#priority-ordering)

On any view ordered by priority, simply drag & drop an issue or project above other ones to indicate it is more important. The exact position will be saved globally across your workspace, so that anyone else looking at a view ordered by priority will see these issues or projects in the same relative positions. By default, items without an assigned priority level are now always sorted last.

## [Urgent Notifications⁠

](#urgent-notifications)

When you set issues to have Urgent priority, we'll send a notification to the issue assignee and immediately send an email notification if they have those enabled.

# Private teams

Create private teams for issues that should only be accessed by certain workspace members.

Available to workspaces on our [Business](https://linear.app/pricing) and [Enterprise](https://linear.app/pricing) plans.

## [Overview⁠

](#overview)

If you want a team to be public to all but a particular set of users, consider using the [Guest](https://linear.app/docs/members-roles#guest) role instead of making the team private.

This feature is available on Linear's Business and Enterprise [plans](https://linear.app/pricing). Anyone in the workspace can create a private team or make an existing team private.

Private teams are helpful in cases where:

- Work is sensitive and should be limited to only some team members (e.g. HR, customer data, founders or exec team).
- You want a personal team to keep track of issues.

## [Visibility⁠

](#visibility)

**Private team: **Workspace admins can see all private teams in settings under [Settings > Administration > Teams](https://linear.app/settings/teams), update team settings, or join a private team by adding themselves as a member. If an admin attempts to join a team, they will receive a pop-up warning before confirming.

**Issues: **Those who are not a member of the private team will not be able to see issues associated with the team. You cannot @ mention a member in an issue in the private team if they are not already a member of the private team.\*\*

Projects created under public teams:*\*\* *Projects created under public teams can also be shared with private teams. Only private team members will be able to see that the project has been associated with their team. Similarly, project issues related to the private team will only be visible to members of that team.

If all public teams are removed from the project, it will become private and only visible to members of the private team from then on.

**Projects created under private teams:** Projects created under private teams are visible to the private team members only. If the project is shared with a public team later on, the project will become visible to others. The name of the private team or issues from that team do not become visible to non-members.

**Initiatives:** Members of a private team can see its projects on the associated initiatives but those projects won't be visible to others.

## [Configure⁠

](#configure)

When creating teams from workspace settings, toggle the option **Make team private**.

To make an existing team private or vice versa, go to your team's settings (right-click on the team from your sidebar) and then scroll down on the team's settings page to the Danger Zone to make the team private.

Any assignees that are not members of the private team will be removed and any subscribers to issues in the newly private team will be unsubscribed.

## [Private team members⁠

](#private-team-members)

The person who creates a private team or converts an existing team to private becomes the default owner of the private team.

Owners of a private team can go to _Members_ (from the team's settings page) to invite other workspace members to the team or promote an existing team member to team owner (admins can search for the team from _Settings > Administration > Teams_ and then select the three dot menu to access this page).

Members of a private team can leave the team on their own, but they won't be able to re-join the team without an explicit invite.

## [Exports⁠

](#exports)

When exporting issues from the workspace using our Export tool, admins can choose to include issues from any private team.

## [API Security Considerations⁠

](#api-security-considerations)

If your workspace has set up custom integrations or apps or is working with third party integrations, please consider their behavior and who has access to their output when adding private team data to Linear issues.

The API, webhooks, and integrations such as Zapier can expose a user's private team and issue titles. It's possible to access private issue data with the API if you are using a personal API key of a user that has access to private teams. Webhooks can also expose data from private teams as webhooks for private teams can be set up by team owners and workspace admins.

## [Integrations⁠

](#integrations)

Some existing integrations have limitations to account for private data, while others will have more complete access to all workspace contents.

# Profile

## [Overview⁠

](#overview)

Your profile found in [Settings > Account > Profile](https://linear.app/settings/account/profile) is where you personalize how other team members will see you in your Linear workspace.

## [Set your profile picture⁠

](#set-your-profile-picture)

The default avatar will be the first and last initials of your account. To add a new photo, hover over the avatar until the edit pencil icon shows up, and click on it. A pop-up folder will show up for you to select the photo you want to update.

Once you've updated your avatar, you cannot remove it—only replace it with another photo.

## [Name and username⁠

](#name-and-username)

Members can set whether they see their team members' full names or usernames in their [Settings > Account > Preferences](https://linear.app/settings/account/preferences). You can adjust these to your preference of how you want others to refer you to.

## [Email address⁠

](#email-address)

Your email address is your unique ID (User Account) for all workspaces you have created a User for. For example:

ActionResultYou joined Workspace A using jane.doe@email.comA User Account was created under jane.doe@gmail.com and a User was created for Workspace A.You joined Workspace B.A User was created for Workspace B under your User Account jane.doe@email.comYou updated your email address in Workspace B to jdoe@gmail.comYour email address for your User Account, Workspace A, and Workspace B was updated to jdoe@email.com. Jane.doe@email.com does not exist.

### [Change your email address⁠

](#change-your-email-address)

To change your email address:

- Go to [Settings > Account > Profile](https://linear.app/settings/account/profile).
- Hover over your email address and click the pencil icon.
- A pop-up box will appear for you to enter the new email address you want to switch to.
- A confirmation email will be sent to both old and new email addresses. You need to click _both_ in order for the new email address to be confirmed.

Changing an email address will change the email address for **_all_** workspaces using the old email address. If you want to change the email address for just one workspace, we suggest inviting that email as a new user and leaving the workspace from the old email user.

If your organization is changing domains and you'd like to change all emails in your workspace, please reach out to us at [support@linear.app](mailto:support@linear.app) from the existing domain and let us know the domain you would like to change to.

## [Personal integrations⁠

](#personal-integrations)

Personal integrations are software integrations in which each user has their own specific account. This helps Linear to associate your Linear user when an action taken in the third-party integration. You can see which of your account integrations are connected with Linear, as well as disconnect them.

## [Leave your workspace⁠

](#leave-your-workspace)

To leave the workspace, click the **Leave workspace** option in Settings > Profile. Once removed, you no longer have access to the workspace. An admin will have to unsuspend your account in order for you to log back in.

# Projects

Create Projects for features or large units of work.

## [Overview⁠

](#overview)

Projects are units of work that have a clear outcome or planned completion date, such as a new feature's launch and are comprised of issues and optional documents. They can be shared across multiple teams and come with their own unique features, progress graph, and notification options.

## [Create a project⁠

](#create-a-project)

Create new projects directly from your workspace or team's project view by clicking the `+` button. This action opens a prompt where you're asked to fill in specific fields. While the only required field is the project name, we recommend also assigning a project lead and updating the project icon for better visibility and organization. To edit these properties later, simply right-click on a project within an [Initiative](https://linear.app/docs/initiatives) or [custom project view](https://linear.app/docs/custom-views#create-views) and select **Edit project**, or click on these properties from the project overview page.

## [Delete a project⁠

](#delete-a-project)

To delete a project that you have in focus, click the three dots next to the project name beside the Overview and Issues tabs and select **Delete**.

From a view containing multiple projects, you can also right click on any project and select **Delete** from the bottom of the menu.

Once you've confirmed this action, your deleted projects can be found in the team's archive under the "Recently deleted projects" tab for 30 days before they are permanently deleted.

## [View your projects⁠

](#view-your-projects)

Each team has a _Projects_ page which organizes the team's projects into a list, board, or timeline. There is also a _Projects_ page at the workspace level so you can view all projects within your workspace in one location.

To explore a specific project, click on it to access the project overview. Here, you'll find a brief project summary, project properties, any associated documents and links, a detailed project description, and a list of project milestones.

## [Add issues to a project⁠

](#add-issues-to-a-project)

Add existing issues to projects or move issues between projects by selecting the issues and using the shortcut Shift P. To create new issues in a project, use C from the project view or add the project property manually if creating the issue from another page.

**How we work**: The project lead is in charge of writing the spec and general execution. Other team members collaborate on the brief, split up areas of work, and then write their own issues.

Issues can only be associated with one project at a time. A workaround would be to create sub-issues for the task, then assign each sub-issue to a different project.

## [Attach issue views to projects⁠

](#attach-issue-views-to-projects)

Next to the "Issues" tab in each project, you'll find the `new view` icon. This feature enables the creation of custom views of the project's issues. By clicking this icon, you can filter a subset of the issues and save this filtered perspective under a specific view name.

Once a view is created within the project, it can be repositioned by clicking and dragging it to the left or right to adjust the order in which these views appear. These views are accessible to anyone who has access to the project and are displayed as tabs, similar to the `Overview` and `Issues` tabs, allowing users to easily share and switch between different perspectives within the project.

Additionally, right-clicking on a view opens options to copy the view link, add it to your favorites, edit its details, or delete it.

**Example views we've attached to projects:** A view we use often is a view that filters for all issues assigned to the `current user`. This ensures everyone viewing a project can quickly view all their issues. We also use a `bug` view that filters for all issues with the "bug" label. A "standup" view filtering for `In Progress` helps us have more efficient standups.

## [Attach project views to workspace projects page ⁠

](#attach-project-views-to-workspace-projects-page)

Similar to attaching issue views to projects, you can also attach project views within the workspace projects page. This allows you to create custom views of projects in your workspace. These views can be repositioned just like attached issue views within projects and are accessible to all members of your workspace.

**Example project views we've attached**: In our workspace, we have attached a project view that filters for all projects with an “In Progress” status. Projects are automatically added to this view based on the selected filters, eliminating the need for manual curation. This makes it easy to reference and see all in-progress projects at a glance. We also have an attached project view that filters for all projects involving a specific team, allowing us to quickly review that team’s activity.

## [Project details sidebar⁠

](#project-details-sidebar)

Press the sidebar icon or use Cmd/Ctrl I to toggle the project details sidebar on or off. You'll be able to update any properties from here as well as add resources such as external files, create project documents, and view the project progress graph.

## [Multi-team projects⁠

](#multi-team-projects)

Projects can be shared across multiple teams. Add more teams when creating a project or from the project details page by clicking on the team name, then marking off more teams in the dropdown. Once you add more than one team, the project view will create tabs so you can toggle between seeing all issues or issues on specific teams.

## [Timeframes⁠

](#timeframes)

Rarely will a project's precise end date be known in its early stages. Select start and target dates that match your level of certainty. Options are available to choose a year, half-year, quarter, month or precise day. Choose start and target dates using these timeframes by selecting the appropriate fields in the project's right sidebar.

You can also use these timeframes in project views in [Initiatives](https://linear.app/docs/initiatives) when grouping by start or target date, or in start/target date filters as well as created at under the "custom date or timeframe…" option.

## [FAQ⁠

](#faq)

Can I make a project for ongoing work?[
](#collapsible-f088bd16d8ba)

Technically yes, you can create a project without a completion date -- but we encourage projects to have a clear start and end. We're looking into better ways to manage this type of work but in the meantime there are a few workarounds:

- Use projects without target dates (you may want to create an Initiative to group these projects)
- Break up the work into smaller time-based projects (e.g. bugweek, Q1 infrastructure)
- In cases where a project should remain unclosed for some time but not forever, consider creating a custom Maintenance project status.

Can I add multiple project leads?[
](#collapsible-d8fe4f59d04d)

We have a single lead field to keep ownership of the project clear. If more people are involved with the project, consider adding them as members, however members have to opt-in to receive notifications.

How is it decided what projects are listed in the project picker menu?[
](#collapsible-848f54643743)

It will default to show you the following options when adding a project to an issue:

Projects you lead, are a member of, created by user recently, has overlapping teams with user, active, recently created, then cancelled and completed.

Where is the roadmap timeline view?[
](#collapsible-846e2805cb0c)

Roadmaps are renamed to Initiatives and can be enabled in your workspace settings.
Timeline views are available on any view with projects in your team projects view, inside an initiative or the workspace projects view. You can choose a timeline view under "Display".

# Select issues

Take actions on groups of issues.

## [Overview⁠

](#overview)

Highlighting or selecting one issue both allow you to take actions on the issue using keyboard shortcuts, the command menu, or right-click to bring up the contextual menu. The two differentiates when it comes to multiple issues.

By default, no issue is selected when you open a board or list of issues.

## [Highlight an issue⁠

](#highlight-an-issue)

- Hover over the issue with your cursor until the issue is highlighted
- Use ↑ / ↓ or J / K to navigate the page to the issue.

## [Select issues⁠

](#select-issues)

- Once an issue is highlighted, press X shortcut.
- Hold Shift and _click_ your mouse on the issue.
- Bring up a checkbox element by moving your cursor over the far left of any issue (near where the issue meets the sidebar).

### [Select multiple issues⁠

](#select-multiple-issues)

Once an issue is selected, use the navigation to highlight another issue and press X.

To select multiple _consecutive_ issues:

- Hold down Shift after selecting the first issue, then use the ↑ / ↓ keys to increase the selected range one issue at a time.
- Use filters to refine the issue list first, then use Cmd/Ctrl A to select all issues on a board or list.

### [Clear selection⁠

](#clear-selection)

Press Esc will clear selected issues on your list or board.

## [Take actions⁠

](#take-actions)

Once an issue or set of issues are selected, use Cmd/Ctrl K to open the command bar and select the preferred action or right-click anywhere on the selected issue(s) to open the contextual menu for a list of available actions.

### [Moving issues to top, bottom, or in increments⁠

](#moving-issues-to-top-bottom-or-in-increments)

To move an issue or issues up or down the list:

- In the _Display Options_, set the Grouping to **No grouping**.
- Set the _Ordering_ to **Manual**.
- Select the issue(s) you want to move.
- Use the shortcut Option/Alt Shift ↑ or Option/Alt Shift ↓ to move an issue/issues in increments.

### [Update multiple issues⁠

](#update-multiple-issues)

Select them with shortcuts or the mouse and then update the issue field like you would any issue. Common bulk actions will show up at the bottom.

- **Select all keyboard shortcut:** To change issue priority so all issues without a priority were assigned no priority, filter to no priority issues and then used Cmd/Ctrl A then P to update the priority.
- **Use mouse to select multiple issues:** To move some issues from Todo to backlog, select by hovering over them and individually marking the checkbox that popped up.
- **Use keyboard to select multiple issues and bulk action toolbar:** Holding down Shift while moving the up/down buttons to select multiple issues and choose a bulk action such as Move to backlog.

# SLAs

Automate SLAs for issues that should be completed within a certain amount of time.

Available to workspaces on [Business](https://linear.app/pricing) and [Enterprise](https://linear.app/pricing) plans

## [Overview⁠

](#overview)

SLAs (Service-level agreements) automatically apply deadlines to issues when they match your defined parameters. While traditionally used to describe service level agreements with your customers, SLAs can also be used to maintain internal standards for how quickly bugs will be fixed and time-sensitive issues will be resolved.

## [Configure⁠

](#configure)

Enable the feature in [settings](https://linear.app/settings/sla) under _Workspace > SLAs_, then use the workflow builder to create rules for when to apply an SLA to a newly created issue.

SLAs won't be applied to existing issues that have already been prioritized. Changing the priority of an existing issue will trigger SLAs however once the change matches your SLA rules.

## [Basics⁠

](#basics)

SLAs appear on issues as a fire icon which transitions from gray > yellow > orange > red as an issue nears and breaches the SLA. Once the issue is completed, the SLA field remains and indicates completion time down to the minute and whether the SLA was achieved early or failed.

SLAs are automatically created on any issue that matches the rules set in SLA settings. You can also manually add SLAs to issues if desired.

### [Default SLAs⁠

](#default-slas)

When you enable SLAs, you'll enable a set of default rules:

- When Priority is Urgent, add a 24 hour SLA
- When Priority is High, add a 1 week SLA
- When Priority is Medium, Low, or No Priority, remove the SLA

You can edit, delete or create new SLA rules as desired.

### [Create new SLA Rules⁠

](#create-new-sla-rules)

Select _New Rule_ to create a new SLA rule.

Set the time interval to any of the following durations:

- 12 hours
- 24 hours
- 48 hours
- 1 week
- 2 weeks
- 4 weeks
- Custom time: Hour, Day, Business day and Week

You can filter by almost any field to specify when SLAs should be applied, including *Team, Status, Assignee, Creator, Priority, Labels, Project, Project Status, *and* Initiative, *and filters can be combined.

### [Business Day SLAs⁠

](#business-day-slas)

When configuring an SLA with a custom time period, you can choose business days as your unit of time to exclude days that are not a part of your work week.
By default Business days are considered Monday through Friday.

On the SLA settings page, you can choose optionally to set your work week to Sunday > Thursday. This will affect your SLA calculations and other features that skip working days, like [nudges on project reminder updates](https://linear.app/docs/initiative-and-project-updates#initiative-and-project-update-reminders).

When setting an SLA manually on an issue, you can choose business days or standard days when choosing a duration.

### [Remove SLAs⁠

](#remove-slas)

Linear's default SLA rules contain conditions to remove SLAs when priority is marked as Medium, Low, or No priority. These "removal" rules are helpful to maintain data hygiene, so that if an issue's priority is downgraded, SLAs which are no longer relevant will be removed. We recommend keeping these in the workspace.

### [SLA status and filtering⁠

](#sla-status-and-filtering)

Linear groups SLAs into different SLA statuses. You will be able to filter and organize views of issues by their SLA status, and the different statuses will be indicated by the color of the SLA icon.

SLA statusDefinitionLow riskMore than 1 week away from SLAMedium riskWithin 1 week of SLAHigh riskWithin 1 day of SLABreachedSLA has passedAchievedIssue was completed within SLAFailedIssue was completed after SLA was breached

### [SLA notifications⁠

](#sla-notifications)

Subscribers to an issue with an SLA receive notifications in their Inbox when SLAs are 24 hours away from being breached as well as when SLAs are breached. Individuals can opt in to receive notifications whenever any issue in their Team has an SLA, too. Manage these notifications in [settings](https://linear.app/settings/account/notifications) under _Account > Notifications_.

### [Viewing SLA issues⁠

](#viewing-sla-issues)

You can filter any view to see issues according to SLA status: *Breached, High Risk, Medium Risk, Low Risk, Achieved, Failed, *and _No SLA._

[Insights](https://linear.app/docs/insights) offers a helpful way to evaluate how well you're meeting your SLAs. Filter a view by SLA, set Insight parameters to _Issue count_ (measure) and _SLA status_ (dimension) to see a clear breakdown of how well you're meeting your SLAs.

### [Manually apply SLAs⁠

](#manually-apply-slas)

You can add SLAs to issues even when they don't apply to a predefined rule. Select the three dot menu from the issue creation modal to apply an SLA.

Note that if you create an SLA that conflicts with a "removal" rule, the SLA will automatically be removed after the issue is created. In these cases, you can override the rule but only if you add the SLA by editing the issue after it's created (not during issue creation). Do so from the issue view by selecting the three dot menu, then _Set SLA_.

## [FAQ⁠

](#faq)

What is the best way to view SLAs?[
](#collapsible-be162c0b23a9)

We recommend creating a custom view filtered down to issues that contain SLAs. You can group the view by SLA status and also use Insights to explore the data.

Can I add custom names for SLAs?[
](#collapsible-78ea0d71c908)

No, we do not offer custom naming for SLAs.

When does Linear send a notification to subscribers that an SLA will be breached?[
](#collapsible-ab474e1e2710)

Subscribers will be notified 24 hours prior to a potential SLA breach.

What's the relationship between SLAs and Due dates?[
](#collapsible-72937d97f114)

An issue may use either due dates or an SLA, but not both. If an issue has a due date and then has an SLA applied, the due date will be replaced by the SLA

# Sub-teams

Group sub-teams underneath a parent team. Feature settings configured in the parent team drive alignment throughout the group.

Available to workspaces on our [Business](https://linear.app/pricing) and [Enterprise](https://linear.app/pricing) plans.

## [Overview⁠

](#overview)

Sub-teams allow you to reflect your organization's structure in Linear, making it easier to understand and manage work across different levels of your company. Create new sub-teams to organize work into specialized units as your organization scales while keeping existing workflows standard within the group.

Concepts like cycles and labels set in a parent team are inherited by its sub-teams, allowing sub-teams to operate well both as individual units and as a unified whole.

## [Basics⁠

](#basics)

### [Update an existing team to a sub-team⁠

](#update-an-existing-team-to-a-sub-team)

Go to Settings > Teams > Team hierarchy and select another existing team as its parent. Taking this action requires admin permissions. To protect the privacy of private teams, a private parent team may have only private sub-teams.

### [Create a new sub-team⁠

](#create-a-new-sub-team)

When creating a new team, optionally designate it as a sub-team at creation. To protect the privacy of private teams, a private parent team may have only private sub-teams.

### [Configure a sub-team ⁠

](#configure-a-sub-team)

Once you've created a sub-team, a wizard will take you through any conflicts that need to be resolved. Common tasks include normalizing statuses between parent and sub-teams and resolving duplicate label conflicts.

After configuring a sub-team, check its settings to customize features unique to that team (GitHub PR automations, for instance) to ensure they meet the sub-team's needs.

### [Parent team feature settings inherited by sub-teams⁠

](#parent-team-feature-settings-inherited-by-sub-teams)

Certain settings from a parent team are enforced throughout all sub-teams.

FeatureInheritance by sub-teamsMembershipMembers in a sub-team must also be members of the parent team. Guests are the exception to this and may belong to a sub-team but not its parent.StatusOptionally, sub-teams can elect to inherit statuses from their parent team.CyclesIf a parent team has a cycles schedule defined, all sub-teams will inherit the same schedule. If the parent has no schedule then sub-teams may define their own. When merging a sub-team cycle schedule with a parent's, past cycles remain untouched. The current cycle on the subteam will close, and upcoming cycles of the sub-team update to the closest parent cycles.EstimatesOptionally, sub-teams can elect to inherit estimation settings from their parent team.

### [Parent team feature settings accessible to sub-teams⁠

](#parent-team-feature-settings-accessible-to-sub-teams)

Sub-teams benefit from other features used in the parent team, and retain the flexibility to create similar entities scoped to the sub-team.

FeatureUse in sub-teamLabels Issues in a sub-team can use labels scoped to the sub-team, its parent team, or the workspace.Templates Issues in a sub-team can use a template scoped to the sub-team, its parent team, or the workspace.Views Sub-teams can have dedicated views. Issues in sub-teams are accessible in the views stored in their parent teams.

### [Independent feature settings in sub-teams⁠

](#independent-feature-settings-in-sub-teams)

Other features in sub-teams have no relation to the parent team and should be customized to meet the needs of the sub-team specifically. These include:

- Team timezone
- Recurring issues
- Team Slack notifications
- GitHub/GitLab automations

### [Private parent and sub-teams⁠

](#private-parent-and-sub-teams)

If a parent team is private, its sub-teams must also be private. If a parent team is public, its sub-teams may be public or private.

As with all private teams in Linear, a user can see private team-specific data only when they belong to the private team themselves.

As an example, given a private parent team A with private sub-teams B and C, a user belonging to A and C cannot see issues belonging to B, even if those issues are in a project or view shared with teams A and C. If there is a project shared between teams B and C, this user would only see issues belonging to team C in the project.

# Teams

Create teams in your workspace to organize different types of work functions.

Different plans support different numbers of teams: details available [below](https://linear.app/docs/teams#team-limits).

## [Overview⁠

](#overview)

A workspace is composed of one or many teams. Teams typically represent groups of people who work together frequently, though in some cases you may choose to structure teams as parts of a product. Teams contain issues, and can have team-specific projects (though projects can also be shared between teams).

By default, when you create a workspace we'll generate a team for you with the same name. It's up to you how to split up teams and users can be part of one or many teams.

Consider grouping teams by:

- Teammates who work together frequently.
- Areas of work such as marketing, mobile app, etc.
- Keeping everyone on one team is the simplest approach (best for small teams).

If you aren't sure how to split up your teams, start with one or two. It's easy to add more teams in the future, copy settings from existing teams, and move issues from one team to another.

## [Your teams⁠

](#your-teams)

Teams you have joined will appear in your sidebar.

Each team has the following pages to organize your work:

- [Triage](https://linear.app/docs/triage)\* Newly created issues to be reviewed, assigned or prioritized before entering the team's workflow
- [Issues](https://linear.app/docs/default-views) Default views of all issues in this team
- [Cycles](https://linear.app/docs/use-cycles)\* Review current, past and upcoming cycles to plan and schedule your team's workload
- [Projects](https://linear.app/docs/projects#view-your-projects) Default views of all projects linked to this team, along with custom views of projects that you can add and edit.
- [Views](https://linear.app/docs/custom-views#overview) Custom views filtered to this team's issue, visible to members of the team

Sections marked with an \* are opt-in and need to be enabled in team settings.

### [Team settings⁠

](#team-settings)

Team settings allow you to configure each team differently to support different workflows.

To access your team's settings:

- From the app sidebar, hover over the team name, click the three dots `···` menu, and select "Team settings."\* \*
- From Settings, find the team you want to update from Your teams and select it. It'll take you to the team's unique settings page.

From the team's settings page, you can update the name, icon, and identifier for the team. Changing the issue identifier is a safe action to take -- old URLs containing the original identifier will automatically redirect to the new issue URL.

You can also configure the following settings:

Team settings pageConfigureGeneralSet timezone. estimates, create issues by emailMembersManage team membersIssue labelsManage team-level labels and label groupsTemplatesManage team-level issue, project, and document templatesRecurring issuesView all existing and create new recurring issuesSlack notificationsSet team-level notifications to SlackIssue statuses & automationsCustomize workflows, add and edit statuses, set up git automations and branch naming preferences, enable auto-close and auto-archiveTriageEnable Triage, assign Triage responsibility (compatible with PagerDuty and incident.io)CyclesEnable and configure cycles, set cycle automations

## [Working with other teams⁠

](#working-with-other-teams)

### [View other teams⁠

](#view-other-teams)

Teams you navigate that you are not a member of will show up in your sidebar under a temporary _Exploring_ section.

You can search for and view issues, projects, and documents from other teams, too, as long as those teams are not private.

### [Access control⁠

](#access-control)

All members of a workspace can view and join teams as long as the team is not private.

Anyone in the workspace can create issues for other teams or be assigned issues in other teams, too. You don't have to join teams to collaborate with others unless you use them frequently and want them to show up in your sidebar.

## [Create teams⁠

](#create-teams)

To join other teams or create a new one, navigate to settings and select "Join or create a team" from the bottom of the settings sidebar.

- In [Settings](https://linear.app/settings) below the list of your existing Teams, click the + "Add team"
- From command bar Cmd/Ctrl + K, select "Create new team"
- Admins can create teams from their [Teams page](https://linear.app/settings/teams) in settings

### [Team limits⁠

](#team-limits)

The number of teams that can be created is dependent on a workspace's subscription:

PlanTeam limitFree2Basic5BusinessUnlimitedEnterpriseUnlimited

### [Team creation settings⁠

](#team-creation-settings)

**Private teams:** During team creation, you'll have the option to copy over settings from an existing team and make the team [private](https://linear.app/docs/private-teams).

**Copy team settings**: If you want to copy an existing team's settings when creating a team, use the "Copy team settings..." option when creating a new team.

**Restrict team creation**: Admins can restrict team creation to only admin users under [Settings > Administration > Security](https://linear.app/settings/security).

### [Tips on structuring teams⁠

](#tips-on-structuring-teams)

Keep these tips in mind when deciding how to structure your workspace's teams:

- **Issues are tied to teams**. Think about how you prefer to manage your work and interact with features such as the backlog and archive.
- **Workflows can be customized per team.** Different work areas or internal teams (e.g. engineering, design, marketing, sales) may require different statuses.
- **Cycles are team-specific**. You can set up cycles so that all teams follow the same schedule, but you can't view more than one team's cycles at once. Think about how you manage your work, run meetings, measure progress, and whose work you'll want to oversee as a manager.
- **Projects** can belong to a single team or be shared across many teams (but issues can only be tied to one team)
- **Sub-issues** can be assigned to any team or member in the workspace, not just the parent issue's team.
- **Other features** are team-specific but also easy to copy over to another team, such as pull request automation and issue templates. Labels are team-specific but you can create views that show issues from multiple teams as long as the label has the same name across them.

## [Manage teams⁠

](#manage-teams)

### [Make a team private⁠

](#make-a-team-private)

Business and Enterprise support [private teams](https://linear.app/docs/private-teams). To make an existing team private, go to _Settings > Your teams > Team_ and then scroll down to the Danger Zone.

### [Join / leave / invite teams⁠

](#join-leave-invite-teams)

Admins can add users to a team in [**Settings > Administration > Members**](https://linear.app/settings/members).

Members can join and leave teams on their own, by hovering over the team name, then clicking the `···` and selecting to **Join team** or **Leave team...** To join a private team, members must be invited by the team owner.

### [Sub-teams⁠

](#sub-teams)

On Business and Enterprise plans, you can organize teams in a hierarchy (for instance, Mobile might be the parent team of iOS and Android). Learn more about sub-teams [here](https://linear.app/docs/sub-teams).

### [Delete a team⁠

](#delete-a-team)

Deleting the team will also permanently delete its issues. Once the grace period ends, this can't be undone and your data cannot be recovered by Linear.

You will have **30 day grace period** to restore the team under _Recently deleted teams_. Access this by opening Settings > Teams and selecting the *Recently deleted *option in the menu. Restore a team through its overflow menu on the far right of its row.

If you may need the data in the future, consider making the team private, exporting the team's issues as a CSV before deleting, or moving the issues to a different team.

# Triage

Manage issues created by other teams and customer support integrations.

## [Overview⁠

](#overview)

Triage is a special inbox for your team. When an issue is created by integration or by a workspace member not belonging to your specific Linear team, it will appear here. Triage offers a opportunity to review, update, and prioritize issues before they are added to your team's workflow. Consider using Triage responsibility to set a rotating schedule of ownership for monitoring incoming issues.

## [Configure⁠

](#configure)

Go to your _Team Settings > Triage_. Once you toggle it on, Triage will appear under the team name in the sidebar.

## [Basics⁠

](#basics)

Navigate to Triage with G then T. If you are in another team's views, use O then T to open the team you want to view first.

### [Create issues⁠

](#create-issues)

New issues will default to Triage status if they are created through an integration (e.g. Slack, Sentry), created when inside of the Triage view, or if members outside of your specific team create the issue.

Setting default templates in Team Settings > Templates can override the triage status.

### [Take actions⁠

](#take-actions)

Open the issue to review it and take one of the following issue actions: _accept_ with 1*, mark as duplicate *with 2*, decline* with 3*, or snooze* with H.

Accepting an issue will offer the option to leave a comment and then move the issue to your team's default\* \*status.

To ask for more information from the user who created the issue, comment on the issue and keep it in Triage or snooze it until you're ready to take an action.

**Marking as duplicate** will offer a choice of which existing issue to merge the duplicate into. Taking this action will also move the new issue's attachments to the canonical issue, including [customer requests](https://linear.app/docs/customer-requests) and attachments. Once selected, the new issue is updated to a _Canceled_ status type. The shortcut MM also triggers the mark as duplicate action.

**Declining** will update the issue to a _Canceled_ status type and present the option of adding a comment with an explanation.

**Snoozing** will hide the issue from the triage queue to return at a time of your choosing, or when there's new activity on that issue: whichever comes first. See snoozed Triage issues by toggling the preference in View Options. Snoozing hides the issue in Triage from other users by default as well.

### [Product Intelligence⁠

](#product-intelligence)

On Business and Enterprise plans, our Product Intelligence feature allows LLMs to analyze every new issue in triage against your existing issues to suggest properties like assignee and label, and pro-actively surface likely related issues or duplicates based on the analysis of the issue's content against historical behavior in your workspace. Learn more about Product Intelligence [here](https://linear.app/docs/product-intelligence).

### [Triage rules⁠

](#triage-rules)

Triage rules functionality is supported on our Enterprise plan.

On Enterprise plans, configure custom rules to take automated actions on issues when they enter Triage. Triggered on filterable properties, triage rules can update an issue's team, status, assignee, label, project and priority.

Once configured, rules are executed in order from the top down. When moving issues to another team's Triage via rule, the new team's rules are applied to the issue as well. If rules conflict, this is surfaced in the interface.

Consider combining triage routing with [custom Asks fields](https://linear.app/docs/linear-asks#creating-additional-fields) to create a scalable system to intake issues from Slack. Users fill out what they know and automations send the issue to the right team or assignee.

### [Triage responsibility⁠

](#triage-responsibility)

Triage responsibility is available on our [Business](https://linear.app/pricing) and [Enterprise](https://linear.app/pricing) plans.

Enable triage responsibility to define who handles incoming issues. You can select specific members of your workspace to receive notifications of new issues or be automatically assigned to them. Configure triage responsibility in your team's Triage settings.

Once triage responsibility is set, optionally connect your PagerDuty, OpsGenie, Rootly, or Incident.io schedules to automate the rotation of first responders. If you use another provider, we have opened up that [API](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/Linear-API/variant/current/schema/reference/objects/Mutation?query=timeScheduleUpsertExternal#timeScheduleUpsertExternal) so you can build a custom schedule.

Members of your team will be able to easily see who is currently assigned to monitor triage when creating issues.

## [Integrations⁠

](#integrations)

### [Asks⁠

](#asks)

Use Triage to seamlessly intake issues reported from non-Linear users through [Asks](https://linear.app/docs/linear-asks).

### [Support integrations⁠

](#support-integrations)

Get more out of Triage by connecting it to our support integrations—Intercom, Front, and Zendesk—or Slack. Using these integrations, your support team can create new Linear issues or link customer reports to existing issues directly from their customer support tool.

## [FAQ⁠

](#faq)

Can I require priority to be set before an issue leaves Triage?[
](#collapsible-6554f37d047c)

Yes. Configure this behavior under Team Settings > Triage.

Why are issues in Triage not showing up in my views?[
](#collapsible-11bbc5452305)

By default, we exclude triage issues from all views since triage is considered to be outside the normal workflow. To include them in a custom view, you need to explicitly include them by adding a status filter where "Triage" is included.

# User views

See views that show you how work is distributed across your team.

## [Overview⁠

](#overview)

You'll often want to create a view that shows issues assigned to one or more members of your team. There are a few ways that we make this visible: user profiles, assignee grouping, filter by assignee, and the cycle sidebar.

KeyboardMouseCommand menu

O then U to open a user profile

- Click your avatar to view your profile
- Click on a user's name in activity items to view their profile

`open user` to open user profile

`open profile` to open your user profile

## [Basics⁠

](#basics)

### [User profiles⁠

](#user-profiles)

To see a view of all issues assigned to a specific user, you can open up a user profile. The easiest way to do this is with the shortcut O then U, which will show a list of all users in your workspace. Select a user to go to their profile where you'll easily see their assigned issues (top bar next to their name) and can filter or scan the list. You can also access user profiles by clicking on a user avatar in the activity feed.

### [Custom Views⁠

](#custom-views)

If you'd like to have a view show the assigned issues of multiple users, or if you'd like to change the view's parameters, [custom views](https://linear.app/docs/custom-views#create-views) are more flexible than user profiles.

### [Filter and Group⁠

](#filter-and-group)

Most views supporting grouping by assignee. If you want to see distribution of remaining work in a project for example, you can group by assignee and then filter by *Started *and _Unstarted_ statuses.

### [Cycle sidebar⁠

](#cycle-sidebar)

From any cycle view, use Cmd/Ctrl I to open a sidebar that shows the cycle details, graph, and distribution of work across the team. Next to each user's name, you'll see a total issue or estimate count for their issues in that cycle as well as the percentage completion. Hover over a specific user's name to filter the list or board view down to their issues only.
